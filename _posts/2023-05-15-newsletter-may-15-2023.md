Beppu Top by: ITO Yarn & Design</a>

The perfect oversized summer top! The materials are comfortable to wear and keep you cool in the summer heat.One size to fit most, but easy to tweak it as you like it. You can add stitches or rows to make it your own as the style is quite basic.<br /><br />

Flirty by: Kate Oates</a><br /><br />

This convertible pullover features sweet texture detail, pleated sleeves and A-line shaping. Designed with a higher front neckline & scooped back neck, instructions are written so that it can truly be worn with either neckline at the front. This light, mild weather knit includes options for short or long sleeves and cropped or longer length. Sweater is worked seamlessly from the top down with raglan-style sleeves.<br /><br />

We are suggesting sport weight Queensland United for this project.<br /><br />
