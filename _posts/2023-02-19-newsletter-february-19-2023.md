Thank you to everyone who popped into the shop or purchased on-line for the sock yarn sale. We really enjoyed seeing all of you!

<h2>Yarn Focus - Today we want to introduce you to Kremke Soul Wool: Reborn Jeans</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/reborn-jeans"><img src="/img/yarn_focus.jpg"></a><br />

Reborn Jeans is made from post-consumer recycled jeans, and is delightfully soft. The feeling resembles a mixture of bourette silk and wool. The color range is narrow and that is done on purpose: sticking to the original colors of the denim means no additional chemical processing is needed, such as bleaching it and dying it again. The Polyester part of the yarn is made from recycled PET bottles. The raw material is sourced in India, where the yarn is spun by the same father-and-son owned company that produces Reborn Wool.

<h2>Hermione's Everyday Socks: by Erica Leuders</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/hermiones-everyday-socks"><img src="/img/everyday_socks.jpg"></a> <br />

Hermione, as described in J.K. Rowlingâ€™s Harry Potter Series, is a rather smart and practical heroine. While she can dress up with the best of them, these socks remind me of something she might wear while practicing charms or transfiguration or reading up on Arithromancy in the Gryffindor Common Room.

This sock is knit from the cuff down and features a garter stitch edged slip stitch heel. The pattern itself is written for one size, but with a 4 stitch pattern repeat, it is easily customizable to fit whatever size one desires.

Reyna shawl: by Noora Backlund

Did you just purchase the best skein of sock/fingering yarn? Or are you wanting to make a quick project that will hold your interest? Reyna shawl will do the job. This one has been around for several years but it is an easy knit and requires only 1 skein of fingering weight yarn. Great wearing for these late winter, early spring days. We all seem to have grey, black or navy winter coats. Perk them up with something bright & fun.
