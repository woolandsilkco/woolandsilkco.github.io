<h2>Knitting Inspiration</h2>

<h2>Fog Cutter: by Thea Colman</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/fog-cutter"><img src="/img/fog_cutter.jpg"></a> <br />

This one is a striking but simple sweater that’s just perfect for a foggy day at the beach or a cool summer night. Fog Cutter is versatile, flattering, and easy to throw on. It features a beautiful combination of cables, lace, and texture in a panel that undulates like waves over small stones. A split hem, some ribbed detail, and boldly seamed shoulders also add to the interest on this design, and reverse stockinette on sleeves and back keep the focus on the details.

Finished sweater Sizes (with 5" positive ease-measured at the bust) 37.75" to 59.75"<br /><br />

We are introducing <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/reborn-wool-recycled">Kremke Reborn Wool Recycled</a><br /><br />
another contribution to the slow fashion movement! With a wooly and natural feeling, and rich colours that have a somewhat gentle tweed-like effect, this yarn makes the most of post-consumer recycled textiles. Made from a blend of recycled wool garments 65%, recycled polyster sourced from PET bottles 25%, and nylon 10%, it is perfect for clothing and accessories with a classic look. 200m/220yds. 13 colour choices!

     <h2> London Fog Slipover by Caidree</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/london-fog-slipover"><img src="/img/london_fog.jpg"></a> <br />

London Fog is a beginner friendly knitting pattern. It is bold and chunky vest/slipover that will effortlessly keep you dressed up and warm. You will cast on and work in the round continuously to shape the front and back plus saddle shoulders, then separate the front and back to shape arm holes and after that you will connect the front and back to work the body in the round. The slipover is worked in stockinette stitch all the way through. It is meant to be worn with little ease. 0 – 10 cm of positive ease is built into the pattern.

Sizes XS to 5XL<br /><br />

230-600yds of Superbulky yarn<br /><br />

 you may also combine 2 strands of a chunky or a bulky yarn to create a superbulky. I would suggest doing a gauge swatch if you do this.<br /><br />

    <h2> Under the Rainbow shawl by Collete Audrey</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/under-the-rainbow-3"><img src="/img/rainbow_shawl.jpg"></a> <br />

What a great way to use a colour gradient yarn cake! This easy to knit pattern begins at one tip and goes to the other with a set of increases and thrown to complete the border.

Yarn amt: 875yds<br /><br />

Size:<br /><br />
About 170 cm (70 inches) long after blocking.<br /><br />

We think that KFI's <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/kfi-collection-lace-degrade">Painted Lace Degrade </a>is perfect. Don't let the word "lace" put you off. It is a 4-strand fingering weight yarn in 100% cotton. And at 874yds it is just perfect for this project.
