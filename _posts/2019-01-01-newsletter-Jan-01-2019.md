<strong>Guest Indie(Independent) Dyer is coming! - January 19th, 2019 - 10am-3pm</strong>

So excited to welcome our first Indie Dyer to the Wool & Silk Co.
 
Come in & say hi to Jesika Hughes from Many Hues Fiber Studios
 
Jesika comes to us from Orangeville, Ontario. Who knew?   Many-Hues yarns are hand-painted in small batch runs; no two skeins are the same!
Her primary yarn focus is fingering-weight, with a spotlight on self striping sock yarns. Currently dyeing with a 80/20 superwash merino with nylon blend.  She is looking to expand into worsted weight yarns, and has a single ply superwash merino that should be ready for January 19th.
