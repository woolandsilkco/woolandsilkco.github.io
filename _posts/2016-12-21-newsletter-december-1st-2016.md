**Christmas Gift Giving!!**

Do you have a knitter to shop for?
Or are you needing to provide ideas for you own Christmas list?  
We have lots of options in store! 

In the store suggested gifts are marked with bows. Anything can be made up into a kit for your favourite knitter to enjoy. If you are already "friends" on Ravelry you will be able to look at each other's favourites & library which may provide ideas as well. There are always gift certificates available if it is too hard to decide, (you determine the value).

A few ideas:

- Eucalan (wool wash) sm or lg
- needles (straight, circular, wood, metal, so many   choices!)
- hand made stitch markers
- needle sets (DPN & circular)
- shawl kits (ready to go or we can kit one for you)
- a skein of that "special" yarn
- pattern holders - small & large (so handy)
- knitting bags & baskets
- magazines
- books
- accessories
- yarn, yarn & more yarn!
