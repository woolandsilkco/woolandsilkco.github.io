<p>Estelle Eco Tweed DK</p>

<p>Eco Tweed DK is a wonderful yarn for use next to the skin – from sweaters and shawls, to classic accessories! Because the GOTS classes all shorn animal fibres as “wool” we have to call it wool, but it’s actually 50% Wool, 25% Alpaca (which accounts for the luxurious softness of this yarn) and 25% Cellulose Viscose (Lyocell.)</p>

<p>$18.50 per skein</p>
