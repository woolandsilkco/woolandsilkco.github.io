<p><a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/23-01-texture">23-01 Texture Scarf by Nancy Lekx</a><br /><br />

Here is a little, luxurious project to knit for yourself, or for someone special. Designed originally for DK weight yarn, it works up quite quickly, and the simple 4-stitch, 2-row repeat lends itself to meditative knitting. Knit on the bias, the parallelogram shape creates graceful points on the ends, and the rich texture traps air and helps insulate from the cold.<br /><br />

We are suggesting Drops Baby Merino Sport for this project.<br /><br />

Pattern on Ravelry $2.50 CAD<br /><br />
