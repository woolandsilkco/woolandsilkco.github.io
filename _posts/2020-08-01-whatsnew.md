<strong>Get Ready 4 Christmas</strong>

<img src="/img/xmas2020a.jpg" /> 
Each year we set up 4 kits for Christmas knitting. This year we are featuring a ladies hat (Confection Sparkle)-chunky, a cowl  (Slip Stitch Cowl)-super bulky,  lounging socks (Movie Night Slipper Socks)-super bulky & a man's hat (Hill 60)-worsted.
**All of the projects are in worsted weight or higher which make for quick knits in the pre-Christmas rush**

Each kit comes complete with all materials to knit the project and the patterns. You must take all 4 to get the great discount price.

$72.00  (Reg $82.00)
