<strong>The Sharon Show - Mystery KAL shawl (start date August 6th)</strong>

<img src="/img/aug2020_sharon.jpg" />
<img src="/img/aug2020_yarn.jpg" />If you are looking for a fun project then this is the one for you. I say fun because the designer is her cat, Sharon from Security. There will be humour, cute pics and great knitting. If you don't enjoy cat fun or jokes in your knitting time then this is not the one for you. If you do then you are in for a treat. Giggle along!

Cassapinka has created a mystery KAL. Uses a combination of four great colours. We have set up a few ideas for you on our page. Prices vary due to yarns chosen.

<strong>FRESH BERRIES TEE - KAL-AD (Knit-a-Long at a Distance)</strong>

<img src="/img/aug2020_berry.jpg" />
 
We thought we would try to do a Knit-a-Long at a distance. Sign-up happens at time of yarn purchase (in-store or online). Pattern is supplied.

Each week we check in with you, ask for updates & photos. Then we share them on our social media so that everyone can see how the knitters are progressing.

Fresh Berries Tee is a great top-down knit. Nothing hard here. The yarn does all of the work for you. And what nice yarn it is. So soft and cozy. Easy to wear and lots of colour choices. New stock coming next week.

Can't wait for you to join us!
