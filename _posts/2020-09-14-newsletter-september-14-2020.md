<img src="/img/horse_sweater.jpg" /> 

 Are you starting to feel the need to reach for a sweater? Me too. It was cold and damp the other day and I just went nuts and turned on the furnace. (I think I'm getting old - lol). No holding out till October for me. At this same time of year our minds turn to cozy knitting. Just like our little sweatered friend above here, we feel the need to work with warm woolies.

The 2020 Lakeside Yarn Crawl has drawn to a close. This week we did our in-store draw from all of the ballots that were collected over the past 2 months. Penny B. was our excited winner. She will receive a kit to make the Crawl Shawl and is busy entertaining colour combinations as we speak. Congratulations Penny!

<img src="/img/summer_sale.jpg" /> 
September 15-19

The dog days of summer are ending and so we are selling off our summer stock. A fabulous 20% off on all summer weights and fibres. All over the store. Just look for the little beach umbrellas! 

PS: I had to drink approximately 20 Margaritas to collect these little babies. I was happy to make the sacrifice.

<h1>Poncho Focus</h1>
At the start of fall, what could be more perfect than a poncho. We have quite a few ideas for you in store. This one is the Dusk Poncho. Knitted in Universal Yarns Colourburst. We have several gorgeous colourways in stock. Only 2 balls to make this quite generous poncho. Pop in and have a look.

<h1>FRESH BERRIES TEE
KAL-AD (Knit-a-Long at a Distance) - Update</h1>
<img src="/img/kal_update.jpg" />
Quick Update - Fresh Berries Tee - KAL at a distance   

I have been very poor with the "weekly" updates".  Here are a few photos of three projects. The top left photo is the sweater by Ann A., already completed in the original colour. The soft pinks, lower right is being knitted  by Dannielle A. and is just nicely underway - but knowing her she is much farther along than when I asked for this photo! And the almost there (just one sleeve edge to go) one in the lower left is by our own Leeanne L. Aren't all of the colours beautiful. We still have stock in this yarn and now it is 20% off for the end of summer sale. These tops are oh so soft and cottony and just perfect for this time of year under a light jacket. Come in and see all of the options.

(Fresh Berries Tee is a great top-down knit. Nothing hard here. The yarn does all of the work for you.)
