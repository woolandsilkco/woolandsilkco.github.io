2. Learn to Crochet Kit>br /> If you think knitting might not be the right fit, then perhaps a Learn to Crochet kit would be better. This is also an easy to complete dishcloth project. Six bright colours.

4. Corking Sets<br /> Do you remember the fun you had crafting with corking? I loved it. These corkers are far more interesting than the wooden thread spool that we used. Choose from the Princess or the Bumblebee. A dk weight yarn will work well with these.
<br /><br />
$5.99 to $13.49<br />
