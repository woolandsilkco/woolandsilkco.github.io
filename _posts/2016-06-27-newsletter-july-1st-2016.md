Luxe Lace Pullover
</a>

The feature project this month is the Luxe Lace pullover by Lion Brand Yarn. A light as air pullover knitted in Drops Kid-Silk.  The Super Kid Mohair & Silk combination is lovely to work with. A simple lace panel on the lower front adds feminine detail. It has a loose generous fit and is just the thing to slip on over a light top or dress on a cool summer evening.  Takes (4) balls to make the medium size.  Model shown in colour #24 Petrol (a deep teal)  Yarn for this project is 15% off (not including cost of   needles). Pattern is free on Ravelry   (we will print in-store for $1)

Mismi Shawl
</a>

Mismi Shawl _by Andrea Rangel_
Here is a chance to work an easily constructed shawl in a new yarn!  Knitted out of  Downton Abbey – Lady Sybil, Mismi provides a cosy shawl with a reversed
contrast.  Using an oyster (or light) colour for the centre and a deep colour for the border.

   Dates (Wed’s): June 22, July 6 & August 3
 - this KAL has already started but you are welcome to join on July 6th   


**Technique Class – German Short Rows                       $10.00**

While knitting the Danzig shawl [(Danzig Shawl)](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/danzig) Leeanne recognized the value of working German Short rows instead of the traditional wrap & turn short row.  Makes a neat & tidy turn and a nicer finished product.  Come & join us for this single class and learn a new technique!  You don’t have to be knitting the Danzig shawl to attend. This has many practical purposes in collar construction and other shawls.

**- a single class** (6:30PM-8:30pm)  Wed June 29th
