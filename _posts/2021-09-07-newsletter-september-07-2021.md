  <h2>10 WEEKS OF X-MAS</h2>

10 Weeks of Christmas starts next week!

Rules & Regs

1. There will be a weekly email with a different feature product(s) & a code for the online shopping discount

2. The featured item(s) will be on sale for that week at 15% (or more) off. The sale is only valid for the week that particular product is offered. (9am Sunday to midnight the following Saturday)

3. Items will be available in-store, on-line(you must use the code) & for curbside pickup

4. Items are to be paid for at time of purchase & may be picked up immediately (this is new!). No waiting until the end as in previous years. That way you can get X-mas gifts knitted and wrapped in time.

5. There may be a delay to fulfill if the item is out of stock. Many items have been difficult for us to source during the past year. We are featuring products in this sale that we feel we have stock of or will have access to. Fingers crossed. Thank you for your understanding.

6.  No special orders will be taken
