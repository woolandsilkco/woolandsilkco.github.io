- Spring and Summer Yarns are Here
- 1st Spring Knit Along - Foghorn Top

**Spring Has Sprung !!!**

Well, Spring is here or we hope so at last.  The brighter days are very welcome.
Thank you to everyone who joined us on April 2nd for the super sell-down.  Hope you got some great deals for those projects you've always wanted to do. 

**Spring & Summer Yarns are Here!**

No need to stop knitting just because winter is over. Lots of  lovely cottons and blends are now in-stock for your summer enjoyment. Lots of colour choices and lovely weights to use.  Cascade Avalon, Amalfi DK, Little Bird -sport, Beachcomber DK and more! 

We are going to be continuing with the Feature Project each month. It will have the yarn available at a 15% discount and you will work on it on your own.

_A new change  with our KAL's._ Now to be worked as a group class on Saturday mornings 10am-12pm. Every so many weeks there will be a new Knit A Long offered.  It will be a project that features a particular yarn (sometimes a new one into the store) or a certain technique or both together.  The yarn, pattern & accessories will be offered at regular price but the class will only be a single one-time fee (not per session) ($20, $40 or $60). Schedule of  group class will be listed with each KAL.

      A beautiful casual sweater to wear with slacks or jeans. Light enough to be
comfortable but still warm enough to keep you cozy. If you have never tried top-down knitting this might be the project for you to start with.
