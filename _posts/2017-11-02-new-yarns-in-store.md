Dapple by Sirdar - A double knitting available in 5 colours with more to come. 75% Acrylic, 25% Wool. 330m/360yds. With a pretty speckle/splatter. We have a lovely knitted vest in store for you to see (pattern available). And a second pattern for a single button cardigan

Imagination by Sirdar - Chunky spackled yarn. 100% acrylic. Great for hats & scarves!

Spirit by Hayfield - Double knitting. Soft, slow colour changing yarn. Lovely cardigan & pullover patterns are available for the 8 colours in stock.

Ilusion by Hayfield - Double knitting weight. A spectacular yarn to make a scarf, hat or cowl from. Bright colours on a black backround make a stunning contrast.
