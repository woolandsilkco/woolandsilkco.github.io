<h1>Fall Sweater Idea</h1>
<img src="/img/fall_sweater.jpg" /> 
To help you get started into the fall season we will be featuring some Fall Sweater Ideas. 

If you have been into the shop you will have most likely noticed this stunning <a fref="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/the-purl-code-cardigan?mc_cid=1be35fe942&mc_eid=5dbcc3b01d">Purl Code cardigan</a> by Isabell Kraemer. She writes such a great pattern. We knitted it up in Mid-Knit Cravings's merino <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/sweet-sock?_pos=1&_sid=d0026fa0f&_ss=r&mc_cid=1be35fe942&mc_eid=5dbcc3b01d"> Sweet Sock fingering</a>. What a wonderful yarn! Tonal colours seem to look great for this one. But if you want the "purl code" to show more obviously then we would suggest a flatter, plainer colour. Lots to choose from and more coming in about 4-6 weeks. This one will be that great "go to" sweater for everyday. 

Pullover version available<a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/the-purl-code?mc_cid=1be35fe942&mc_eid=5dbcc3b01d"> ( Purl Code Pullover )</a>
