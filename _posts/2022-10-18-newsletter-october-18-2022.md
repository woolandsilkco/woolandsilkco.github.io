4 for October Xmas Specials
Reminder !
Rotary X-mas Baskets Knitting

Each year we gather newly hand knitted items to contribute to the Rotary X-mas Baskets. If you enjoy knitting and have extra hats, scarves, cowls, mittens, sweaters, etc please bring them into the shop to add to our hamper. Baby & childrens items, teens & young adults and of course Mens & Womens. We donate the items at the early part of December so please try to get yours in to us in October or November. Thank you so much in advance for your generosity.

<h2>4 for October - Xmas Feature</h2>
Available October 1st to 31st

The more you buy the better the discount!

To help along your X-mas knitting, here are 4 quick & easy projects. Available in-store or online. These are the codes for online:

Buy 1 Kit at regular price - no code

Buy 2 Kits at 5% off (Code OCT2)

Buy 3 Kits at 10% off (Code OCT3)

Buy 4 (or more) Kits at 15% off (Code OCT4)

You must select each project individually and then apply the proper code at the checkout. I think that multiples of the same kit are okay but you will have to add them to the cart individually. Unfortunately I cannot run more than 1 automatic code at a time, therefore you must enter them manually. The system will only let you do it if you have selected the correct number of October items.

(These are all worsted weight projects)

4. Work Sock Socks pattern is an in-house pattern. We have added our own twist for a work sock look. If you have made the mitts & the hat then you need to do the socks to complete the set! Or make a pair for some one you think needs toastie toes. They will work up quickly and be a great gift. (pattern included)<br /><br />
