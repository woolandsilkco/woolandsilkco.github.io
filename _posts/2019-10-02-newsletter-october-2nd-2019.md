- 10 days of Christmas 
<strong>Day #2</strong>
Bags & Baskets<br />
Looking for somewhere to stow all your great knitting stuff?  Why not a fabulous bag or basket?<br />
(Note: bags & baskets do not include the contents shown in photos)
$$ in Red is sale price ($$ in Black is regular price)
Our bags are a great size 18"x10"x9". With lots of interior pockets, a zip closure and a top that stays open when you set it up on the floor.So handy to take a project in to your knitting group

We also have 1 aluminum frame basket that is smaller(18"x10"x9.5") & does not have a lid(see photo #2)<br />

Our woven baskets are hand made by a women's collective in Ghana. And their purchase helps support those women. We source them through Big Blue Moma, a small Canadian company. They come in a range of styles and colours and are lovely for storing a project, or just to have beside your favourite knitting chair with some stash in.
Please note that all of the baskets except the largest blue ones are singles(only 1 of each available - first come, first served)<br />
