<strong>It is Time for the 10 DAYS of Christmas !!</strong> Yes, you read that right. This year we are going to do the 10 in 10 days instead of 10 weeks.

It's time to enjoy some pre-Christmas savings & fun. Beginning on Monday September 30th we will be e-mailing you a feature product each business weekday (Mon-Fri), for a total of 10 days.

You can decide whether or not you would like that product and how many you want (some quantities are limited by stock amounts). Everything is featured at 15% off. Get gifts for the knitters on your list or treat yourself to a few things at a good savings!

<strong>How it Works:</strong>
A simple phone call to the store (519) 925-6194 will reserve your purchase. All items must be paid for in full at that time. Alternately, you may e-mail us with your selection and a contact number. DO NOT send credit card info by e-mail as that method may not be very secure.

You can continue to order from previous days as the program goes along. (example: if it is day 4 you can still order from days 1, 2 & 3).

All items will be bagged & held at the store until the start of pickup on October 21st. Items are not available to you before this date. While we do our best to fill all orders the choices are first come first serve and this may apply to in-stock colours, etc. Items will not be wrapped.<br />

Bags & Baskets<br />
Looking for somewhere to stow all your great knitting stuff?  Why not a fabulous bag or basket?<br />
(Note: bags & baskets do not include the contents shown in photos)
$$ in Red is sale price ($$ in Black is regular price)
Our bags are a great size 18"x10"x9". With lots of interior pockets, a zip closure and a top that stays open when you set it up on the floor. So handy to take a project in to your knitting group

We also have 1 aluminum frame basket that is smaller(18"x10"x9.5") & does not have a lid<br />

Our woven baskets are hand made by a women's collective in Ghana. And their purchase helps support those women. We source them through Big Blue Moma, a small Canadian company. They come in a range of styles and colours and are lovely for storing a project, or just to have beside your favourite knitting chair with some stash in.
Please note that all of the baskets except the largest blue ones are singles(only 1 of each available - first come, first served)<br />
