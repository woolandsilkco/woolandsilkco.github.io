<img src="/img/balloons.jpg">
So very excited to say that we will be re-opening our little shop again on Tuesday May 19th. Note that hours & days are reduced for now. 
- Sit & Knit's, classes and trunk shows are not
   returning yet  
- <strong>no returns will be accepted (this may continue for
   some time)</strong>
- <strong>no one-on-one project help</strong> - we just can't be that
  close, and handle someone else's work for what
   it takes to assist you

Please read to the end of this announcement for some rules to follow when visiting the store.

<strong>Hours will be:</strong>
Tuesday - Saturday:  10am-3pm every day
      (no evenings)

Not everyone will be comfortable with in-store shopping and of course we will continue to offer
Wool & Silk Co - <a href="http://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/">Online Shopping</a>
