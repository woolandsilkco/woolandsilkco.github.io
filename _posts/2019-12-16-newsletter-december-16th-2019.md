<h1>Boxing Week Sale</h1>

It is time again for our annual Boxing Week Sale. With Christmas & Boxing Day falling on a Wednesday/ Thursday this year we have decided to extend the sale to Saturday January 4th!

<h1>January Secret Envelope</h1>
As in previous years we are offering a surprise envelope. With a purchase during the Boxing week sale you will select a January discount envelope. Your name will be written on it and it will be retained in the store. When you make a purchase in January 2020 the surprise envelope will be opened. A discount of anywhere from 15% - 50% will be revealed and applied to your purchase.

<h1>Time to Sign-up for Winter Classes & KAL's</h1>
Sweaters, Hats, Cowls, Socks & Shawls
By January the rush of the holidays is over and it is time to settle down to some serious knitting!

Note:   We are now offering Saturday Classes !!
To try to accommodate our knitters who are not able to attend classes during the week, we have added Saturday morning dates (10-12am). Not all projects will be available on all days. We have tried to make it as interesting as possible for everyone.

Projects will be 1 - 3 classes in length (please watch your dates)
and KAL's will begin with 1 or 2 classes and extend for 8-10 weeks to complete the project.

Some will require knitting homework before the class or a pre-requisite to be able to complete. So please read the project descriptions carefully. 

Prices are all inclusive: 
Yarn (you choose the colour we choose the type)
The Boxing Week sale does not apply to classes or the yarn required for classes/KAL's. They are already discounted in the combo pricing.
Pattern
Lesson(s) 
HST is additional 
Needles are not provided or included

Classes begin January 13, 2020 so make your selections & get signed up now!
