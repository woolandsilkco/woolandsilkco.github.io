<h2>Introducing  The Retreat At the Farm</h2>

When have you last had uninterrupted time to work and enjoy friends, food and fun? Quilt, Knit, Sew, Weave, Scrapbook, do Yoga. Whatever makes you, well......you!
Come and retreat to our 100ac farm nestled in Mulmur Township and close to the town of Shelburne. Surrounded by farmland we offer a Victorian era farmhouse that will sleep up to 10 people.
There is a big workroom with tons of natural light is set up for 8 work stations. An attached room offers an area for ironing & cutting (2 mats, bring your own rotary cutters). Let your creative juices flow! The large living room features lots of comfortable seating and sunny southern exposure. Relax! Relax!
You can wander around the grounds and down the back lane where you may see wildlife. Near dusk is a great time to spot a deer!
The fully equipped kitchen has seating for 10 with the table extended. Bring meals with you or dine out at several fantastic local restaurants. As well there are many beautiful shops to visit within short distances.
Then head back to relax at the farm and enjoy a wonderful night's sleep on a comfy be.
