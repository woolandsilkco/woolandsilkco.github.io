<h1>Summer Knitting</h1>

<img src="/img/summerknitting.jpg" /> As all regular knitters know, we keep on with our craft no matter what the season. The above photo is of Dannielle A.'s hands working away while out on her deck. A perfect way to enjoy the weather & your project.
 
Just a quick reminder here of our current hours. These will remain in place until such time as we are allowed to host classes and Sit & Knits. Everyone is missing their group knitting times! And we miss seeing all of you. Oh the fun & giggles we have. Hopefully soon. We will update you as soon as we hear anything. 

<strong>Hours will be: Tues - Sat:  10am-3pm every day  (no evenings)</strong>

New Store Protocols:

1) for the safety of all of our customers: do not visit the store if, you have a cough, fever, have been exposed to a COVID-19 patient, or have a person in your household who may have been exposed. Staff may ask you at the door.

2) The wearing of a mask is now mandatory. Our staff will be wearing masks while interacting with customers. Please come in supplied with your own mask. 

3) there will be a limit of 3 customers in the store at any time. Please check before entering

4) social distancing (keeping 6ft from others) will be maintained in the store

5) upon entry you will be given hand sanitizer

6) please limit yarn handling to items that you are intending to purchase

7) payment will be limited to:  Tap (Interac, Visa, M/C). Cash is not being accepted at this time

8) the washroom will be for staff use only. Please plan ahead & do not ask us. Thank you.

Please adhere to the above rules & regs as we do not wish to be fined (It's $5000 !!) or shut down. Thank you so much for your consideration.

- no returns will be accepted (this may continue for some time)
- no one-on-one project help - we just can't be that close, and handle someone else's work for what it takes to assist you

Not everyone will be comfortable with in-store shopping and of course we will continue to offer <a href="http://woolandsilkcoshop.com/">Wool & Silk Co - Online Shopping</a>

(Best method for ordering)

<img src="/img/julylogo.jpg" />Debbie at the Loving Path has shipped us some spectacular yarn!  It is on her polar fingering base which is a single ply merino. So luscious. Oh and the colours.....to die for. These are just the new shades. We currently have 14 colourways in stock. All are available on-line as well as in store. Stop by to check them out.

<h1>The Slipped Rib Hat</h1>
 
This is the hat that is being created in the first photo of the newsletter. An easy slipped rib pattern using Vintage DK & mohair held together to create a fun & fluffy look. We have created several colour combinations that we think will make great looking hats. Pattern & pompoms are not currently included in the kits.
