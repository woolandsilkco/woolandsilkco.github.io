from Diane:  Here is a pair under construction. First sock is completed and I have immediately cast on the second sock. So important! Let's not have those lonely single socks hanging around. Hint: I use 2.5mm needles to knit my socks, but I use 3.0mm's for the cast on & first round. I also do the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwmCuIylII&mc_cid=3e8d8cac72&mc_eid=5dbcc3b01d"> German twisted cast on. </a> Both of these things give a little extra stretch at the top of your sock
Yarn is from a trip to Florida. Pattern is Sock Recipe: A Good Plain Sock by Stephanie Pearl McPhee (the Yarn Harlot). Pattern is in her book Knitting Rules! (cannot buy this pattern on it's own). But any vanilla(plain) sock pattern will do.

These great shorty socks were knitted by our own Dannielle A.
Dannielle has just knitted her first pair
She did a great job
Be like Dannielle !

Yarn is Drops Fabel. We do not have this colourway in stock but any striping yarn will give you a great effect. Because they are short you would be able to get 2 pairs from one 100g ball/skein. Free pattern on Ravelry.

Love this textured pattern. If you have that great single skein of sock yarn with a lot of mixed colours then this is the pattern for it. Really shows off your yarn. Free download on Ravelry.

Here's a great pattern by our own Leanne Lange. If you want a sock with just  a bit of patterning instead of an all over design then try this one. Enough to keep you busy but not enough to drive you crazy. Pattern purchase on Ravelry.

For something a bit thicker and cushier you could try Rye. Worked in worsted weight they will knit up fast. Free pattern download on Ravelry in sizes from baby to large adult.

Colourwork is also popular in sock knitting. I love the simplicity of this design. Remember to work these in two high contrast colours for the best effect.
