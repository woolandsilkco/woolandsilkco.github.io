<h2>Sit & Knit - April 15</h2>

<p>We have decided to cancel Sit & Knit for April 15th as there is a probability that the weaving class may go over in time and it would make the store quite congested. Thank you for your understanding.</p>

  Gale Tank Top by: Amanda Lilley</a><br /><br />

Start now and have this great tank ready for summer time. The Gale tank is a fairly simple knit which lets the yarn do all the work. Great colour striping makes it look like you had miles of ends to weave in. Knit it in the colourway shown or look at the 6 additional ones!<br /><br />
