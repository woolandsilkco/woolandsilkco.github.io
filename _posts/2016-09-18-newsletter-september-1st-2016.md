Sample knit with them, feel them, squeeze them, enjoy all of the colours.  We are hosting on Wednesday September 21st  from 3pm to 7pm.  There will be wine & cheese for your noshing pleasure.  Tickets are $8.00 and can be purchased at the store or by e-mail at woolandsilkco@gmail.com. You will have to print off your on-line tickets at home yourself. We would have done mail outs as well, but the post office is a bit unsure right now. 

**Project of the Month - Cascade Topper 2**

by Brian Smith
Just what you need for the those cool, early fall evenings. A pop on shoulder covering poncho with a comfortable cowl neckline.  Done in worsted weight superwash wool it knits up quickly with only 3 skeins (1 of each colour). Could also be done in chunky weight with larger needles to make a larger size. All yarns required to make this project are 15% off.

**Grand Opening of On-Line Shopping**

We are thrilled to announce that our store is now offering on-line sales. You can reach our store at https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/ .  Yarn lines are being added slowly so bear with us. We also now have a "shop now" button on our webpage to connect you directly. 

**Return Policy**

As a matter of foresight customers are often encouraged to take an extra skein of yarn, particularly when working on a larger project. This prevents issues with running out of yarn, not being able to get the same colour or dyelot and therefore being unable to finish a project.  While we will accept returns (which most yarn shops do not), we do need to adhere to our return policy which is set out on the customer's receipt.  Please read the bottom portion of your receipt for return details which are outlined here.
1. Returns must be accompanied by a receipt.
2. All reduced/special priced items are considered a final sale and may not be returned. 
3. Yarn must be in exact condition in which it left the shop. Label and skein/ball intact, unused and not having been subjected to cigarette smoke or pet hair/odours.  A return can be declined based on these issues or at our discretion.
4. Needles/notions are non-returnable
5. A full refund will only be issued within 10 days of purchase
6. All other returns, presented within 90 days of purchase (but after 10 days time) will be issued a store credit only.
7. No yarn will be accepted as a return after 90 days.
8. On-line purchases may only be returned within a 14 day time-frame (to allow for shipping)

Thank you for your consideration
