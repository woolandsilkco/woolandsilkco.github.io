<strong> Natural Ewe Yarn</strong>

Andrea Rahmel is visiting us from Bracebridge, Ontario with a trunk show of fabulous yarns. 
 
Andrea tells us:
I want to share my passion for all things colour and knitting related with eco conscious hobbyists. I believe that each of us doing our own small share in making environmental decisions that lead to sustainable living will greatly improve our planet.
The dyes I produce come from my own garden or kitchen, nature in my rural area and sources around the world that promote healthy living.
My sources are Canadian Importers with environmentally conscious agendas.
Let me help you create naturally beautiful hand crafted items.
