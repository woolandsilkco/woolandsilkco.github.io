<strong>Guest Indie(Independent) Dyer is coming! - January 19th, 2019 - 10am-3pm</strong>

So excited to welcome our first Indie Dyer to the Wool & Silk Co.
 
Come in & say hi to Jesika Hughes from Many Hues Fiber Studios
 
Jesika comes to us from Orangeville, Ontario. Who knew?   Many-Hues yarns are hand-painted in small batch runs; no two skeins are the same!
Her primary yarn focus is fingering-weight, with a spotlight on self striping sock yarns. Currently dyeing with a 80/20 superwash merino with nylon blend.  She is looking to expand into worsted weight yarns, and has a single ply superwash merino that should be ready for January 19th.

<strong>Time to Sign-up for Winter Classes - Sweaters, Hats, Cowls, Socks & Shawls

By January the rush of the holidays is over and it is time to settle down to some serious knitting!

Note:   We are now offering Saturday Classes !!
To try to accommodate our knitters who are not able to attend classes during the week, we have added Saturday morning dates (10-12am). Not all projects will be available on all days. We have tried to make it as interesting as possible for everyone.

Projects will be 1 - 3 classes in length (please watch your dates)

Some will require knitting homework before the class or a pre-requisite to be able to complete. So please read the project descriptions carefully. 

Prices are all inclusive: 
Yarn (you choose the colour we choose the type),

Lesson(s) 
HST is additional 
Needles are not provided or included
