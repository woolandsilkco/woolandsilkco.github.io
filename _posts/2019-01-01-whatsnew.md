<strong>Guest Indie(Independent) Dyer is coming!
January 19th, 2019 - 10am-3pm </strong>

So excited to welcome our first Indie Dyer to the Wool & Silk Co.
 
Come in & say hi to Jesika Hughes from Many Hues Fiber Studios
 
Jesika comes to us from Orangeville, Ontario. Who knew?   Many-Hues yarns are hand-painted in small batch runs; no two skeins are the same!
Her primary yarn focus is fingering-weight, with a spotlight on self striping sock yarns. Currently dyeing with a 80/20 superwash merino with nylon blend.  She is looking to expand into worsted weight yarns, and has a single ply superwash merino that should be ready for January 19th.

By January the rush of the holidays is over and it is time to settle down to some serious knitting!

Projects will be 1 - 3 classes in length (please watch your dates)

Some will require knitting homework before the class or a pre-requisite to be able to complete. So please read the project descriptions carefully. 

Prices are all inclusive:
