<strong>Songbird Yarns & Fibres</strong>

Come & visit with Vicki from Songbird Yarn & Fibres. Exceptional yarns with the most glorious colours!  Mark this date
on your calendar. We can't wait!

A little info about Vicki's vision.

She tells us:
Each colourway includes some fun facts about the specific bird I am featuring. I have always been an avid birdwatcher and lover of nature, so I am excited to pass along a little of my bird love to you!  I use acid dyes for squishy, vibrant skeins dyed in small batches in a smoke-free home.  Skeins are dyed by different immersion and hand painting techniques so each batch will be similar, but not an exact match.
 
Over one third of all North American species are at immediate risk of extinction unless there are significant conservation efforts to reduce their declines. I donate $2.00 per skein to Bird Studies Canada to help with these conservation efforts, so you get beautiful yarn and the birds get our help... a win-win!

<strong>**Songbird Yarns will not be included in the sock yarn sale**</strong>
