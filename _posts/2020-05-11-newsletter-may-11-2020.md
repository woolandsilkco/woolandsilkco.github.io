<h1>Lambs!!</h1>
<img src="/img/maynewssheep.jpg" />
Aren't these little guys just the cutest?
It is the first week of May and lambing season is coming to a close. I'm sure to the relief of all of the sheep farmers in Ontario. It is a time of long hours and hard work. Thank you to all of the fibre producers who raise these sheep that garner us such beautiful yarns. On that note, here is a ridiculously cute video of little lambs playing!

<h1>Canada</h1>
<img src="/img/maynewscanada.jpg" />
To Our Wonderful Customers:

I have made a firm decision that when we reopen and begin to function with normal business (whenever/whatever that may be), that I will be making a concentrated effort to purchase Canadian first. Whether from a Canadian grassroots indie dyer, fibre producer or distrubuter. I realize that I may not be able to only carry Canadian and not all labels will say Canadian. But if even the distributer is here then a portion of that money stays in this country and supports it.
 
On that note I hope you will join me in this effort of shopping Canadian, and choosing our local shops & small business enterprises for your purchases. They will need you now & in the future, more than ever if they are to succed and remain open.

Thank you for your support!!
