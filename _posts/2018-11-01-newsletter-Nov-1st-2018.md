<strong>On October 31st we hosted a Knit - A - Boob day</strong>

To celebrate all women, and particularly those whom have had breast cancer or undergone mastectomy surgery. Due to the generous donation of your knitting time we were able to send 20+ soft knitted breast prosthesis to Knitted Knockers of Canada. If you were not able to join us for the Oct 31st campaign you can still come in and pickup the pattern. Knockers can be dropped off to us at any time. We are a intake site and they will be forwarded to Knitted Knockers Canada

Yay !!
