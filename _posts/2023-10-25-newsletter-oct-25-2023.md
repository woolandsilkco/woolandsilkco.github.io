Corran Cardigan</a><br />

By Rebecca Clow<br /><br />
	
Do you avoid knitting cardigans/sweaters because you are just "too hot" all the time? Then this might be the sweater just for you. The Corran Cardigan is an all-over lace cardigan, knit from the bottom up with drop shoulders. There are two neckline options: round and V-neck and two sleeve lengths.<br /><br />

This pattern can be knit in a wide variety of fibres making it a perfect transitional piece. To see the Corran knit in a variety of yarns and with various modifications, please see the #CorranCardigan on Instagram. Pattern has an excellent clarity rating and a lower difficulty rating.<br /><br />
