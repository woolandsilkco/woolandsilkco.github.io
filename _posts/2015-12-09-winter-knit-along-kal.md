Our winter knit along has begun.  It is the Icelandic jacket Lilja in the newest Lopi pattern book #34.  Please stop in the store to view this new book & check out the fabulous Lopi colours.  Even if you did not start on December 2nd there is still time to join in the fun. This jacket involves sideways knitting, charts, colourwork, steeking, a bit of everything!
