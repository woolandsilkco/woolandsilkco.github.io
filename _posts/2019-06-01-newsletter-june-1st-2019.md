<strong>Almost time for the Lakeside Yarn Crawl!!</strong>
 
June 1st to September 3rd

Fifteen gorgeous shops to visit, plus Fibre Spirit Festival in Barrie (Aug 24th). In-store draws & giveaways, bags, specialty yarns. Oh the fun of it all! Get your passport in-store and crawl on!

Featuring an exclusive colourway developed for us by Fergus Yarn Co.
 
Our colourway is based on the lovely sunset photo above here. Lisa Taylor (Fergus Yarn Co.) will be visiting us July 20th for a trunk show of her new & exciting colours!
