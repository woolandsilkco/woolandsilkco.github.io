10 Weeks of X-mas is back!!

It's time to enjoy some pre-Christmas savings & fun.
Beginning on Monday September 11th we will be e-mailing you a feature product each week.
You can decide whether or not you would like that product and how many you want (some quantities are limited by stock amounts).
Everything is featured at 15% off. 
Get gifts for the knitters on your list or treat yourself to a few things at a good savings!

How it Works:
A simple phone call to the store will reserve your purchase. All items must be paid for in full at that time. We prefer that you do not send an e-mail as credit card info by that method may not be very secure.
You can continue to order from previous weeks as the program goes along. (example: if it is week 4 you can still order from weeks 1, 2 & 3).
All items will be bagged & held at the store until the start of pickup on November 27th. Items are not available to you before this date.  

Mondays Reminder

Just reminding you that we are now open on Mondays to help you with your after weekend knitting & crocheting needs.

Come in & see what's new!
