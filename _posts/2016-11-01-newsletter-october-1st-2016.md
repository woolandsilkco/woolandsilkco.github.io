October is breast cancer awareness month. To support survivors we are now a drop station for knitted knockers. These are soft prosthetics made from Cascade Ultra Pima cotton. Knitted using a free, easy pattern that is available in store.  We will be offering all yarns for these projects at 15% off for the month of October.  They can be made in any colour as you can see in the photos above. October 19th will be Knocker Day.  A demo will be given at each sit & knit session and the pattern will be discussed for new knocker knitters. (No stuffing required. We submit them to Knitted Knockers of Canada for you in a flat format)                              
Let's make some knockers! 

As an added feature, for the month of October, all pink yarns (of all varieties) will be 10% off  

**The 10 Weeks of Christmas continues.**
