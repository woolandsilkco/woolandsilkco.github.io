<h2>Spring Knitting !</h2>
<p>Here are a few ideas to inspire you for spring knitting. Lots of great yarns. Tons of great patterns. Don't stop now!</p>

Women's Knitted Sweater by: Sisko Salpakivi</a><br /><br />

I am including this pattern because it is a straight up V-neck women's sweater pattern. It is worked flat in sections (ie, back, front, sleeves separately) and is found free on Ravelry.

Knitted in worsted/aran weight yarn it will complete in a decent amount of time and provide you with that go-to sweater for those colder evenings.

Perhaps knit on the sections during the spring/summer and it will be ready for fall wearing. You won't have the whole sweater in your hands until the end and it will be a portable project.

The original yarn indicates 18sts/4 ins on a 5.0mm needle. We are suggesting<br /><br />

Old River Road by: Kay Hopkins</p></a><br /><br />

A traditional Henley pullover with a modern twist. Itâ€™s the perfect pullover to wear with everything. Picture it over a linen dress or with your favorite jeans and boots. Timeless style and total comfort!<br /><br />

Easy textured stitch pattern. You can choose your hemline finish too & even do the contrast finish on the Henley button placket.<br /><br />

Construction is top-down & in the round in a completely seamless manner. The yoke & body are worked back & forth until the front Henley opening is closed & then the body is worked in the round.<br /><br />

We are suggesting <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/united">Queensland United</a> for a great light-weight cardi.<br /><br />

 Tanke Top by: Ankestrick<br /><br />

Worked seamlessly from the top down. An interesting knit, construction wise. Beginner friendly. Optional pockets and hood.<br /><br />

This pattern is looking for a fingering weight yarn and we are thinking that Berroco's Remix Light is just the ticket. A beautiful lightweight yarn made up of nylon, cotton, acrylic, silk & linen. It has a soft cottony feel. Huge selection of colours to help you make it your own.<br /><br />
