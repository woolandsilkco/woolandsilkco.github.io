<h2>Spring Knitting !</h2>
<p>Here are a few ideas to inspire you for spring knitting. Lots of great yarns. Tons of great patterns. Don't stop now!</p>

Women's Knitted Sweater by: Sisko Salpakivi</a><br /><br />

I am including this pattern because it is a straight up V-neck women's sweater pattern. It is worked flat in sections (ie, back, front, sleeves separately) and is found free on Ravelry.<br />

Knitted in worsted/aran weight yarn it will complete in a decent amount of time and provide you with that go-to sweater for those colder evenings.<br />

Perhaps knit on the sections during the spring/summer and it will be ready for fall wearing. You won't have the whole sweater in your hands until the end and it will be a portable project.<br />

The original yarn indicates 18sts/4 ins on a 5.0mm needle. We are suggesting<br /><br />

Tuck Shorties by: DUCATHI</p></a><br /><br />

Lots of folks like a short sock in their runner. This is a great top-down pattern that has everything.<br />

The highlight on these socks are the tucks on the ankles. They keep the short sneaker socks in place and merge into a delicate pique pattern and the popular Lane socks heel. As a counterpart to the tucks at the top, the toe is knitted in stripes.<br />

Some great solids can be found with the 16 colours of <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/cascade-heritage">Cascade Heritage</a><br />

Then choose a <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/copy-of-painted-desert">10g Teenie Weenie Wool</a> ball for the complimentary colour<br />

 Elmore - Child Version by: Asa Buchta<br /><br />

We just love this great little short-sleeved children's top. Just enough lace at the yoke to make it interesting. Pattern covers sizes 2-12 and is knitted in dk weight. It is top-down one-piece construction.<br />

The original yarn is a slightly thick thin slub. We are offering a few choices.<br />
