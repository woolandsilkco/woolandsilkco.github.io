<h2>4 for November - Xmas Feature</h2>
Available November 1st to 30th

X-mas is getting closer! Here are 4 quick & easy projects. All in bulky or super-bulky yarns.

Available in-store or online. These are the codes for online:

Buy 1 at regular price - no code

Buy 2 at 5% off (Code NOV2)

Buy 3 at 10% off (Code NOV3)

Buy all 4 at 15% off (Code NOV4)

MIx & Match or choose several of the same kit. You must select each project individually and then apply the proper code at the checkout. Unfortunately I cannot run more than 1 automatic code at a time, therefore you must enter it manually. The system will only let you do it if you have selected the correct number of November items.

On Black Friday (to Sunday) sale, and on Cyber Monday I would suggest just letting the system give you the overall discount.

2. Basic Chunky Slipper by Patons. Remember those great slip-ons from years ago. They were always cozy and super squishy. Well we've gone Christmas style with them. 3 festive colourways to choose from. We are suggesting that you choose a size one smaller than your shoe size (eg: I wear a 8 Ladies so I need to knit the 5/6 size(not 7/8). Or begin your toe decreases at the base of your big toe) These are generous and the garter stitch makes them stretchy. 1 ball will make a pair, 2 for the largest size (makes a size 11-13. Totally wash & wear

4. Raindrops Chunky Hat by Annanitato Lolo

Free pattern on Ravelry. Originally done in an oatmeal yarn we decided to bump it up in this multi Bold Coloured yarn by Lang. 4 great funky mixes to choose from. Then pick a great pompom to sew on the top. You can get this one done in a couple of afternoons. (No. Really you can!)
