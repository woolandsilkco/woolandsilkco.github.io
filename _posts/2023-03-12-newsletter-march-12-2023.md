This hat has cute decreases that makes it look cute both with or without a pom pom!.l<br /><br />

<h2>Headband - Canadian Cottage by Juste Maksimaitis</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/headband-canadian-cottage"><img src="/img/canadian_cottage.jpg"></a> <br />

Written row-by-row instructions are accompanied by photos showing all maneuvers. Headband is knitted flat (back and forth) & then sewn together with a twist. Pattern repeat is a multiple of 2sts over 2rows. Although the headband is knitted with Aran or Bulky weight yarn, the needle size is 1 or 2 sizes smaller than the yarn weight would usually call for. This fact & the pattern stitch itself create a chunky „woven“ texture.<br /><br />

Sizes Kids/Teens to Adults<br /><br />

66-98yds of Chunky yarn<br /><br />

Pattern $4.45CAD on RavelryD<br /><br />
