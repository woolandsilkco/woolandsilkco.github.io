 <h2>Chunky/Bulky, Superbulky Knitting Inspiration !</h2>
<h2>Apres Beanie: by Smeeny Beanie Knits/h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/apres-beanie"><img src="/img/apres_beanie.jpg"></a> <br />

This super chunky, extra cozy folded brim beanie is the perfect project for beginners or a fun pattern for seasoned knitters looking to make a quick, easy-to-wear winter hat. The Après Beanie is my take on a classic ribbed beanie with a chunky brim and is made for that winter vacation in the mountains. This hat has cute decreases that makes it look cute both with or without a pom pom!.l<br /><br />

Adult sizel<br /><br />

Superbulky yarns: Estelle Bulky(solids), Estelle Ripple or Berroco Coco (multis) and more.l<br /><br />

Pattern on Ravelry $8.50CAD<br /><br />

<h2>Double-Split Color Blocked Cowl: by Churchmouse</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/double-split-color-blocked-cowl"><img src="/img/churchmouse.jpg"></a> <br />

Reversible and seamless, this quick-to-knit color-blocked cowl is a double treat! Cleverly constructed with splits on opposing sides, you’ll see a little peek-a-boo of contrasting color when worn. A super fast knit on big needles.<br /><br />

10.0mm needles<br /><br />

<h2>Headband - Canadian Cottage by Juste Maksimaitis</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/headband-canadian-cottage"><img src="/img/canadian_cottage.jpg"></a> <br />

Written row-by-row instructions are accompanied by photos showing all maneuvers. Headband is knitted flat (back and forth) & then sewn together with a twist. Pattern repeat is a multiple of 2sts over 2rows. Although the headband is knitted with Aran or Bulky weight yarn, the needle size is 1 or 2 sizes smaller than the yarn weight would usually call for. This fact & the pattern stitch itself create a chunky „woven“ texture.<br /><br />

Sizes Kids/Teens to Adults<br /><br />

66-98yds of Chunky yarn<br /><br />

Pattern $4.45CAD on RavelryD<br /><br />
