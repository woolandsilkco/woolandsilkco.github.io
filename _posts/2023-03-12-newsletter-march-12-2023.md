<h2>Knitting Inspiration for Wonderball !</h2>

<h2>Flax: by TinCanKnits</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/flax"><img src="/img/flax.jpg"></a> <br />
Flax is a classic knit. It's been out there for 10 years now and is still as wonderful as ever. Great top-down construction with interesting garter-stitch detail on the shoulders and down the outside of the sleeves. Perfect for our featured Melange Wonderball yarn.

Pattern is a free download on Ravelry<br /><br />
