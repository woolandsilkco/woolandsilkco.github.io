<h2>The Lopi Has Arrived!</h2>
<img src="/img/lopi.jpg"></a>After a long wait of almost a year we have been restocked with Lett-Lopi (worsted weight) & Alafoss Lopi (chunky). Our two Icelandic yarns. There are newly added colours as well.

For those of you who are not familiar, this yarn is a woolly wool. Suitable for outer garments or items that you wear over a turtleneck or shirt. And they are warm, warm, warm!
