<h2>X-mas Gift Ideas - 4</h2>

Who enjoys a special skein of yarn better than a knitter/crocheter? And hand-dyed yarns are just the very best.

This week's highlight is: Hand-dyed Canadian Yarns

1.Songbird Some of you may already know Vicki from Songbird yarns. She hails from Stratford, Ontario and brings us this "to die for" sock/fingering yarn. 80% superwash wool, 20% nylon 100g 390m/425yds hand wash cold, lay flat to dry

Beautiful sock yarn inspired by natures birds!

2. Basic Chunky Slipper by Patons. Remember those great slip-ons from years ago. They were always cozy and super squishy. Well we've gone Christmas style with them. 3 festive colourways to choose from. We are suggesting that you choose a size one smaller than your shoe size (eg: I wear a 8 Ladies so I need to knit the 5/6 size(not 7/8). Or begin your toe decreases at the base of your big toe) These are generous and the garter stitch makes them stretchy. 1 ball will make a pair, 2 for the largest size (makes a size 11-13. Totally wash & wear
