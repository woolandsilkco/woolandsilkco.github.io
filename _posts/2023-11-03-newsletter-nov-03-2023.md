Terence Bay Tee<br /><br />

by Leeanne Lange</a><br /><br />

Yes that is our very own Leeanne!! So excited for her to have published her first sweater pattern. We have enjoyed her previous mitten patterns but this is her initial sweater offering. And what a good pattern it is! Writen with options for a lacy or closed yoke. Just so beautiful!<br /><br />

Leeanne is suggesting Berroco Remix Light, MidKnit Light Sock or Queensland's Kathmandu for this project.<br /><br />
