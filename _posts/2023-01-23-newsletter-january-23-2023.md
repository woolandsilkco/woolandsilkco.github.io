<p>Variety is supposed to be the spice of life. So here is an assortment of patterns to hopefully catch your fancy. Lots of great yarn ideas to boot. Let's get some cozy crafting going!</p>
<h2>Key to My Heart Socks: by: The Kitchen Sink Shop. </h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/key-to-my-heart-socks"><img src="/img/heart_socks.jpg"></a> Too early for Valentines? Nope. Get started now on these beauties. Pretty much a vanilla sock with a cute little heart pattern at toe & ankle. You can easily make the leg longer. This top-down sock will be a keeper. We are suggesting the Petal colourway in MidKnit Cravings Light Sock. So pretty. Pattern is $6.00CAD on Ravelry

<h2>Easy Peasy Baby Jacket by: Churchmouse Yarns & Teas</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/easy-peasy-baby-jacket"><img src="/img/baby_jacket2.jpg"></a>  So many babies these days! This is a quick and comfy sweater for ages 6-18 mons. Easy garter stitch knitting and simple construction. Tie or single button front closure. We are recommending Vintage DK for this knit. Perhaps in the lovely Calico colourway. Perfect first sweater for baby or knitter.

<br /><br />Pattern is $8.00US on Ravelry

<h2>Cepes Beret by: Ysolda Teague/h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/cepes-beret"><img src="/img/beret.jpg"></a>

For something different in a hat, why not try the look of a beret. A combination of a dk weight and a mohair make it light and airy, as well as warm.

  <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/alpaca-merino-dk"> Estelle Alpaca Merino DK</a> or <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/highland-alpaca-dk">Highland Alpaca DK</a> held with <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/kid-seta">Kid Seta</a>, <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/drops-kid-silk">Kid-Silk </a> or <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/silky-kid">Silky-Kid</a>. 
  If you don't see the matching colour in one, check the other two. Ribbed & Knitted in the round.

Make it short or make it longer for comfort. Lots of great colours to choose from.

<h2>The Lopi Has Arrived!</h2>
<img src="/img/lopi.jpg"></a>After a long wait of almost a year we have been restocked with Lett-Lopi (worsted weight) & Alafoss Lopi (chunky). Our two Icelandic yarns. There are newly added colours as well.

For those of you who are not familiar, this yarn is a woolly wool. Suitable for outer garments or items that you wear over a turtleneck or shirt. And they are warm, warm, warm!
