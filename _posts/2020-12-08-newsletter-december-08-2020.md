<h1>Happy Holidays Activities</h1>

The Christmas holiday season is quickly approaching. As we all know this year has been challenging to say the least. Knitters have had a bit of a head start with activities as we always have our hands busy.

Once the rush of Christmas Day is over you should be ready for a little bit of "me" time. Why not start a new project during the holiday season? Pop in for a look through our lovely yarns, let us help you search for a great pattern, think of that item you have always wanted to make. 

<h1>Holiday Hours</h1>

Dec 24: 10am - 1pm<br/>
Dec 25 & 26: closed<br/>
Dec 31: 10am - 1pm<br/>
Jan 1: closed

<h1>Samples Sale</h1>

We have decided to continue our 20% off samples sale until Dec 24th (closing at 1pm). All priced store samples 20% off of the tag price. Great Christmas shopping ideas.

Give a beautiful item, hand crafted with loving care.

<h1>Boxing Week Sale</h1>

Monday Dec 28 to Sat Jan 2

(excluding holiday closures - see above)

It is time again for our annual Boxing Week Sale. With Christmas & Boxing Day falling on a Friday/Saturday this year we have decided to open & start the sale on Monday Dec 28th.

<strong>All yarns are 20-60% off</strong>
 
January Secret Envelope

As in previous years we are offering a surprise envelope. With a purchase during the Boxing week sale you will select a January discount envelope. Your name will be written on it and it will be retained in the store. When you make a purchase in January 2021 the surprise envelope will be opened. A discount of anywhere from 15% - 50% will be revealed and applied to your purchase. 

- 1 envelope per customer
- 1 discount application use in Jan/21

<h1>Winter Features</h1>

In January the rush of the holidays is over and it is time to settle down to some serious knitting! While we are still not able to provide in-store classes and are seriously missing our Sit & Knit times, we are going to be offering some feature knits. The idea will be to help provide some interesting projects, new knits and exciting stitiching. These will be posted in January with some yarn ideas and project hints.
