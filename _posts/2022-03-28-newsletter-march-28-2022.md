<h2>Frank Shawl - KAL - March 31, April 14, 28, May 12</h2>
by: Joji Locatelli<br>
<img src="/img/frank_shawljpg">
A very easy and stunning shawl, inspired by the work of artist Frank Stella, this design is a study in geometry.<br>
Triangular pieces are assembled together to create a spectacular wrap with a unique shape that is both beautiful and stunning to wear, with many tips, all in different shades.<br>
I played with a gradient of grays, and my favorite color, gold, to give this shawl a vintage vibe.<br>
The Frank Shawl is constructed as 3 triangular sections, joined together when working the last one of them.<br>
Skill level: Beginner<br><br>
FINISHED MEASUREMENTS<br>
97” (244 cm) from side to side and 39” (98 cm) from top to bottom at deepest point.<br>
See Schematic at the end of the pattern.<br><br>
Yarn:<br>
Takes (4) skeins of fingering weight yarn<br>
