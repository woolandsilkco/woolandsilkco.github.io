<p>Fall is upon us and the knitting has commenced. At the first hint of colder weather our fingers start to itch and we can't wait to get a project on the needles!
We are ready for you here at Wool & Silk. So many new yarns into the shop. Pattern ideas. And bags. Oh the bags!

<p><strong>Asti Spumanti Tee</strong> by Thea Coleman</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/asti-spumante-tee"><img src="/img/astitee.jpg"> </a>
This talented designer has brought us a pattern that is a beautiful combination of cables and colour. Perfect for worsted weights. Just enough sweater to wear now and with a long sleeve top underneath for the whole winter. We are working up a sample in <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/bfl-aran-naturals">BFL aran naturals</a> with <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/cascade-220-superwash-wave">Cascade 220 superwash</a> supplying the colour interest. The base yarn could also be <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/estelle-worsted">Estelle Worsted</a>, <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/vintage">Vintage Worsted</a>, <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/eco-harmony-worsted">Eco Harmony Worsted</a>, <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/highland-alpaca-worsted">Highland Alpaca Worsted.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/alegria-grande-bocados-mini-sets">Allegria Grande mini skeins</a> would work well for the colour sections too.</p>

<p>Pattern available in 10 sizes as a purchase on Ravelry</p>
