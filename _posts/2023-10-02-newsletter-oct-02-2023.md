by Cheryl Toy<br /><br />
	
A lacy ring worked in the round. It features a simple lace pattern, a pretty tree motif surrounded by a delicate diamond. This intuitive lace pattern is simple enough to knit while bingeing your favorite show, yet challenging enough to feel you’re engaged with the pattern. This soft circle is 40” in circumference which means it will hang elegantly in a single loop or wrap twice for extra coziness. Knit on a 3.5mm needle<br /><br />

Yarns:<br /><br />

We think this will be great in a single ply merino. Either a solid or a tonal. We are suggesting <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/topaz">Diamond Yarns Topaz</a>, <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/copy-of-feliz">Manos del Uruguay Fino</a>, <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/merino-slim">Fleece Artist Merino Slim </a>or <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/sweet-sock">MidKnit Light Sock</a><br /><br />

Pattern is available for purchase on Ravelry
