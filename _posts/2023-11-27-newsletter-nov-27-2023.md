Elegant and refined, Fino combines the softness of merino wool with the luster of silk in a lightweight yarn that’s perfect for heirloom accessories or luxurious garments. Fino features a new dye process that yields complex, subtle, tonal colors.

We recommend buying enough yarn to complete a project. To give an overall blended effect, knit two rows from one skein and then two rows from another.<br /><br />
