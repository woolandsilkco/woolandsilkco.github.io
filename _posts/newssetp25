<p>I hate to say it but the days are getting shorter and fall is coming near. Time to start thinking about some fall/winter knits for those cooler days.

Check out our worsted weight yarns. The perfect state of warm. Great for out walking the dog, raking leaves, or enjoying the sunset.

Eco Harmony Worsted is our newest addition. 233m of 55% Organic Wool blended with 45% Organic Cotton. The squish factor is high. 12 beautiful colours. All for $14.50/skein.</p>
