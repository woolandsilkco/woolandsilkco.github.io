<h2>Featured Pattern</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/wool-addicts-footprints"><img src="/img/shiftigan.jpg"></a> <br /> Shiftigan Cardigan by: Andrea Mowry A new addition to the "Shift" series of garments. The shifting colors and fun texture will keep you knitting “just one more row!” all the way to the end, and it is sure to be one of the most eye-catching pieces in your wardrobe! This sweater is knit from the top down, in the round, using stranded colorwork. It is knit seamlessly and then steeked. Easy to make longer if you wish. We are suggesting Fino by Manos , Feliz by Manos , Drops Alpaca , or Juniper Moon's Patagonia for the main colour. Then select a colour changing yarn of either our brand new Wool Addicts Footprints or Berroco Millefiori Light.To create the beautiful patterning. Don't worry about the steeking. We can help you with that!

Pattern is available to purchase on Ravelry $8.00USD<br />

<h2>Hinterland by: Jennifer Steingass</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/hinterland-5"><img src="/img/hinterland.jpg"></a><br />

Inspired by the northern lights in Norway. This sweater features easy top down & seamless construction, is knit entirely in the round, & options for a rolled or ribbed neckline are included. The colorwork yoke is enjoyable, rhythmic, & engaging to knit & with just 2 colors per row, this pattern is suitable for those who are new to colorwork. The cuffs are my favorite part about this design! We knitters often joke about being stuck on sleeve island, but with fun colorwork at the end, it might just motivate you to bang these sleeves out.

All of the colourwork can happen with a yarn like <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/wool-addicts-footprints">Footprints</a> (see above here) or Millefiori Light. You do the knitting and let the yarn do the colour changing hard work.

<br />
We are proud to assist with this program as a drop-off site for completed knockers. Today we packaged up 49 knockers of all sizes to send in. Thank you to everyone who donated their knitting time to create them. If you are interested in knitting some please pop in or go onto their webpage. The patterns are free but specific yarns must be used due to the fact that they must be soft against the skin. See the list on the webpage or ask in-store and we can direct you to the correct ones.<br />
