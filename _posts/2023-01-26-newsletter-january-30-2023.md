<h2>Featured Pattern</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/wool-addicts-footprints"><img src="/img/shiftigan.jpg"></a> <br /> Shiftigan Cardigan by: Andrea Mowry A new addition to the "Shift" series of garments. The shifting colors and fun texture will keep you knitting “just one more row!” all the way to the end, and it is sure to be one of the most eye-catching pieces in your wardrobe! This sweater is knit from the top down, in the round, using stranded colorwork. It is knit seamlessly and then steeked. Easy to make longer if you wish. We are suggesting Fino by Manos , Feliz by Manos , Drops Alpaca , or Juniper Moon's Patagonia for the main colour. Then select a colour changing yarn of either our brand new Wool Addicts Footprints or Berroco Millefiori Light.To create the beautiful patterning. Don't worry about the steeking. We can help you with that!

Pattern is available to purchase on Ravelry $8.00USD<br />

<br />
Fever Dreams Shawl: by: Kate Burge & Rachel Price. An intermediate level pattern that features a simple slipped stitch dot motif and an interesting and easy to memorize honeycomb stitch. You can create it with a main and 3 accent colours or we think a main an 1 colour changing yarn might do very well. Two sizes, 68" or 94" (purchase yarn accordingly) We are suggesting <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/highland-alpaca-fine">Highland Alpaca Fine</a> or <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/collections/estelle/products/alpaca-merino-fine">Alpaca Merino Fine</a> or <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/vintage-sock">Berroco Vintage Sock</a> (it's super soft) for the main colour. You can choose your 3 contrasting colours from these as well. Or perhaps Laines du Norde Paint Sock for some fun honeycombs.
