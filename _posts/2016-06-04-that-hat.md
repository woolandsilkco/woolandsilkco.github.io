We have discovered a fun and slouchy hat called “Wurm”. A free pattern on Ravelry which we have rewritten specifically for a two colour format. This hat is set up as a kit done in Debbie Bliss Baby Cashmerino. 2 balls of the Main Colour and 1 ball of the contrasting colour. All for $23.00 !!! (a 30% savings). What a great Christmas gift to make!
