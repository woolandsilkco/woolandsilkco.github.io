- gauge:  20-23sts/4ins<br />

- handwash in cool water and dry flat<br /><br />

Marla is made from 2 strands of lighter-weight yarn that have been dyed separately and then plied together.<br /><br />

We think this is a terrific substitution for Spincycle yarns of the same weight.<br /><br />

The resulting marled yarn can be high-contrast tweedy (like Twilight) or more subtly tonal (like Nube), or even have some of each in the same skein, (like Merino).
