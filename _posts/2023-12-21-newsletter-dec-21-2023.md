<p>After 9 years I have decided to sell Wool &amp; Silk Co. It's been a great ride but it is time for me to bow out. The shop is being taken over by a lovely lady and there will be a familiar face to greet you. I will send out more details in the New Year. Anticipated change over is early 2024.</p>

<h2>5 Personal Knitting Ideas!</h2>
<p>5 Personal Knitting Ideas !
The frantic activity of Christmas is over and it's time to settle in with a new project just for you. Here is some inspiration.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/smokeshow"><img src="/img/smokeshow.jpg"><br />
Smokeshow vest</a> by: Thea Colman<br /><br />

The overall cable pattern is subtle, with a bit of hidden texture, and the button bands are worked in twisted rib for added visual interest. The ribbed hem plays right into the cable pattern, and the overall effect is simple and classic.<br /><br />

Smokeshow is the kind of knit that may get noticed in any outfit you create, but it doesn’t look for the attention. :wink:<br /><br />

We are suggesting: Lang Yak for this project<br /><br />

<a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/smokeshow">Pattern is available for purchase on Ravelry $8.00 USD<br /><br/>

<p><a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/autumn-alpine"><img src="/img/autumn_alpine.jpg"><br />
Autumn Alpine</a> by: Caitlin Hunter<br /><br />

Autumn Alpine is a midweight sweater knit from the top down featuring an interesting ribbing detail at the neckline, hem and sleeve cuffs and a Scandinavian-inspired floral colorwork yoke. Short rows are worked at the back neck for an improved fit. Optional short rows are also worked at the back hem to lower the back of the sweater a bit. Instructions are given for lengthening the body and sleeves as desired.

We are suggesting: Juniper Moon's Patagonia<br /><br />

29 fabulous colours to choose from.<br /><br />

<a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/autumn-alpine">a purchase pattern on Ravelry $9.00USD</a><br/>
