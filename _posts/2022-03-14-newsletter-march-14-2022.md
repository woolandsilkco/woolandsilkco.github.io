<h2>Hitofude KAL - March 24, April 21, May 5, May 19</h2>

A lace cardigan that is easier to knit than you might think!<br />
<img src="/img/hitofude.jpg"><br />
Call the store to sign up (519) 925-6194<br /><br />
 
Hitofude by:  Hiroko Fukatsu<br />
Purchase pattern on Ravelry.  <br />
As implied by the name “Hitofude”, meaning a single brush stroke in Japanese, this open front cardigan with an allover lace pattern is worked in one “yarn stroke” -- a continuous strand without cutting the yarn.<br />
The yarn stroke starts from the upper body and sleeves worked together in a rectangular piece, then moves to lower body, where the lace pattern increases evenly, creating a gentle drape.<br /><br />

Level - intermediate<br />

Sizes:  30 to 54"<br /><br />

Materials<br />
- fingering weight yarn (2 to 4 skeins)<br />
- check pattern for quantities<br />
 - Needles:  a 3.5mm x 80cm circular, 1 additional 3.5 for 3-needle bindoff,
   crochet hook, waste yarn & stitch markers<br />
- Gauge:  20sts/32 rows = 4in
   in lace pattern<br />
