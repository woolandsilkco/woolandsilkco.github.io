<h2>Hitofude KAL - March 24, April 21, May 5, May 19</h2>

A lace cardigan that is easier to knit than you might think!<br />
<img src="/img/hitofude.jpg"><br />
Call the store to sign up (519) 925-6194<br /><br />
 
Hitofude by:  Hiroko Fukatsu<br />
Purchase pattern on Ravelry.  <br />
As implied by the name “Hitofude”, meaning a single brush stroke in Japanese, this open front cardigan with an allover lace pattern is worked in one “yarn stroke” -- a continuous strand without cutting the yarn.<br />
The yarn stroke starts from the upper body and sleeves worked together in a rectangular piece, then moves to lower body, where the lace pattern increases evenly, creating a gentle drape.<br /><br />

Level - intermediate<br />

Sizes:  30 to 54"<br /><br />

Materials<br />
- fingering weight yarn (2 to 4 skeins)<br />
- check pattern for quantities<br />
 - Needles:  a 3.5mm x 80cm circular, 1 additional 3.5 for 3-needle bindoff,
   crochet hook, waste yarn & stitch markers<br />
- Gauge:  20sts/32 rows = 4in
   in lace pattern<br />

<h2>Project Idea #10 Spring series - Dame De Fer - a beautiful lightweight cardigan. Exactly the right thing for spring.</h2>
 <img src="/img/dam_de_fer.jpg"><br />
Dam De Fer<br />
By: Marie Amelie DesignsDam De Fer<br /><br />

A free pattern on Ravelry<br /><br />

Decorated with an easy-to-work slip stitch pattern, this cardigan will have you dressed for the Eiffel Tower in no time. Inspired by the ironwork that makes up the exquisitely engineered tower, you will work from the top down, seamlessly to have a season-spanning sweater tout de suite. Pattern provided in both charted and written formats.<br /><br />

We are thinking of our new Alpaca Soxx 4-ply for this project. Fingering weight, 70% alpaca, and oh so soft and squishy. You can make socks out of it but why would you?

<h2>Fix-It Fridays!</h2>
Do you have a project that has you stumped? Or a pattern that's just a pain? We can help you with that. The third Friday of each month will be designated as Fix-It Friday. Bring your project and let's get it sorted out.<br />
Format is drop-in, no appointment required<br />
Please remember that it is important to bring all aspects of your project. Yarn (with the ball band if possible), pattern, needles you are using and any other information that you may think is pertinent.<br />
Note: this is not a Sit & Knit or a class. It is for a short session of help with a specific problem.<br />
If you have something extensive to work out then you may want to book private session time with an instructor (rate is $20/hr)<br />
 <hr />

<h2>Sit & Knit Hours:</h2>
Wed's  1pm-3pm<br />
Sat's    12pm-2pm<br /><br />

Please join us for some knitting fun & laughter. First date will be Wed Feb 9th. Attendance is free.<br />
You may bring your own drinks, munchies or treats as you like. We are no longer serving coffee/tea.<br />

<h2>Knit & Nosh</h2>
         <img src="/img/knit_nosh.jpg"><br />                     
It was lovely to see everyone out last Wednesday night at the Tipsy Fox on Main Street in Shelburne. Good food, good company, & good conversation (read laughs). We are hoping to continue this as a monthly event. The first Wednesday of each month. I will be putting it into an email as a reminder as the venue may change from time to time.
Can't wait to see you there!
