<h1>Time to Sign-up for Winter Classes & KAL's Sweaters, Hats, Cowls,Socks & Shawls</h1>
By January the rush of the holidays is over and it is time to settle down to some serious knitting!

<h1>Note:   We are now offering Saturday Classes !!</h1>
To try to accommodate our knitters who are not able to attend classes during the week, we have added Saturday morning dates (10-12am). Not all projects will be available on all days. We have tried to make it as interesting as possible for everyone.

Projects will be 1 - 3 classes in length (please watch your dates)
and KAL's will begin with 1 or 2 classes and extend for 8-10 weeks to complete the project.

Some will require knitting homework before the class or a pre-requisite to be able to complete. So please read the project descriptions carefully. 

Prices are all inclusive: 
Yarn (you choose the colour we choose the type)
The Sock Yarn sale does not apply to classes or the yarn required for classes/KAL's. They are already discounted in the combo pricing.
Pattern
Lesson(s) 
HST is additional 
Needles are not provided or included

Classes started in January & the list continues till the end of April. Still tons of projects, lessons, KAL's for you to get signed up for now!
