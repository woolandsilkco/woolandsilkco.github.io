<h1>Lambs!!</h1>
Aren't these little guys just the cutest?
It is the first week of May and lambing season is coming to a close. I'm sure to the relief of all of the sheep farmers in Ontario. It is a time of long hours and hard work. Thank you to all of the fibre producers who raise these sheep that garner us such beautiful yarns. On that note, here is a ridiculously cute video of little lambs playing!
