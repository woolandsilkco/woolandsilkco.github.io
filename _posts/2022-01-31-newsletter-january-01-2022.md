<h2>Project Idea #3</h2>
This is more of a project idea than a kit. The 3rd in our winter series. Southwood (by Galt House of Yarn) is a unisex pullover. A free pattern on Ravelry. Top down with a few short rows at the back of the neck (pattern says front but we know it's the back!), raglan sleeve increases and a straight body without any waist shaping. I am currently knitting this for my son-in-law in Juniper Moon's Rustic Aran. Colourway: 1009 Bayleaf. If you follow us on Instagram or Facebook you may have seen my knitting updates. It's going pretty fast.
This is a good first/second pullover pattern for any knitter. I have provided links to the pattern page (click pattern name above or on the photo) and a link to some yarns that I think would make a great sweater for you or the man in your life.
