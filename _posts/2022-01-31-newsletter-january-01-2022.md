<h2>Project Idea #3</h2>
This is more of a project idea than a kit. The 3rd in our winter series. Southwood (by Galt House of Yarn) is a unisex pullover. A free pattern on Ravelry. Top down with a few short rows at the back of the neck (pattern says front but we know it's the back!), raglan sleeve increases and a straight body without any waist shaping. I am currently knitting this for my son-in-law in Juniper Moon's Rustic Aran. Colourway: 1009 Bayleaf. If you follow us on Instagram or Facebook you may have seen my knitting updates. It's going pretty fast.
This is a good first/second pullover pattern for any knitter. I have provided links to the pattern page (click pattern name above or on the photo) and a link to some yarns that I think would make a great sweater for you or the man in your life.

Some of you have been inquiring about stock in Lopi yarns. We carry Alafoss Lopi and Lett Lopi. Currently there are some production/shipping issues in Iceland with this yarn. Our distributor has zero stock in their wearhouse. There is also no idea of when they might receive some new stock.
Please note that all of the Lopi that we have is posted on our online shopping site. All of it. Every colour and ball in the shop! Click on the pictures to take you to those pages. We are hoping to hear some news and as soon as we do we will pass it on to you.
