<h2><font color="red">Holiday Knitting Just for You!</font></h2>
<p>Once again the Christmas/holiday season is upon us. Our gift knitting is completed. Or if not it soon will be. Shopping is pretty much done and you just need to round up the rest of the wrapping.<br/>

You will possibly be hosting a gathering or spending time with <font color="red">relatives</font>. Remember, don't get caught without knitting on the go!!<br/>

This is serious business<br/>

You need some knitting that is all your own. Now is a great time to start on a project that is just for you.<br/>

So many fabulous ideas! See a few suggestions below here</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/monmouth-cap-4"><img src="/img/moncap.jpg"><br />
Monmouth Cap by: Kristina K. Miller></a><br/>Free patter on Ravelry<br/><br />
The Monmouth Cap has a long intriguing history. Particularly given that there is a Monmouth County in New Jersey.<br/><br />

It has been adapted to a modern design based on the designers experience making many other knitted hats while maintaining some of the traditional elements. If you are comfortable with knitting in the round, you will find it is easy to make. And if you are creative there are a variety of ways for you to “make it your own” if you are so inclined--whether adding a pompom or tassel, eliminating or choosing a different decorative band design, etc. Once complete, you may block the hat but it should not be felted as it has been written to fit a normal adult head right off the needles.<br/><br />

We are suggesting: Vintage Worsted, Ultra Alpaca, Highland Alpaca Worsted or Alpaca Merino Worsted for this project<br /><br/>

Frosty Pines shawl by: Isabell Kraemer</a><br/>
This is a purchase pattern on Ravelry - about $7.65 CAD<br/><br />
This dk weight shawl is worked flat (sideways), increasing along one edge to create an asymmetrical triangle. Stitches are increased in pattern and then onward into the 1x1 ribbing. The combination of lace patterns, garter stitch stripes and the sportive ribbing give this shawl a sophisticated, yet casual look.<br/><br />

Difficulty level is lower and it will make for an enjoyable knit.<br/><br />

We are suggesting: Jodi Long Alba<br/><br />

20 gorgeous colours to choose from. Pattern takes (2) Main, (1)each of CC1 & CC2<br/>

Instant Crush by Joji Locatelli</a><br/>Pattern is available for purchase on Ravelry $8.00 USD<br /><br />
A seamless, top-down, colorwork pullover worked using 2 strands of silk/mohair yarn throughout the entire project. We are suggesting a DK weight yarn for this project instead. Bright tones or soft, both look great.<br /><br />

We are suggesting: Berroco Vintage DK for this design<br />

Pressed Flowers Cowl by Amy Christoffers</a><br/>Pattern is available for purchase on Ravelry for around $7.00 CAD<br /><br />
Why not try some mosaic knitting. This cowl is worked flat and the cast on edge is sewn to the bound off edge in the finishing to join in a circle. ‘Plain Stitch’ section of the pattern is used in sizes 42 and 58 only. Difficulty level is lower. Check the "projects" tab on this pattern page for some great colour ideas.<br /><br />

We are suggesting: Berroco Carousel or Fibra Natura Cobblestone for the contrast paired with Vintage DK or Eco Tweed DK for this cowl<br /><br />
