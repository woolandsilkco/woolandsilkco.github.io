To achieve the best look, use these super flexible blocking wires, which will allow you to block your garment into any shape, while keeping a neat edge and giving it the perfect finishing touch. The wires are made from high-grade steel spring wire and therefore, will be rust free, resilient and won’t kink. The wires are covered with rubber for easy insertion and to avoid injuries.
