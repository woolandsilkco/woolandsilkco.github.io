<h2>New Jersey Whelk Hat: by: Christina K. Miller</h2>
<a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/new-jersey-whelk-hat"><img src="/img/jersey_hat.jpg"></a> The Whelk pattern is a lovely and interesting waffle-weave pattern perfect for hats. This pattern consists of a flat folded double brim which then showcases the textured whelk pattern on the body and crown. A simple 4-st by 4-row pattern is easy to work consisting of knit, purl, and slip stitches. Written for an adult head it is easy to size up or size down. On Ravelry: Free! We suggest Estelle Alpaca Merino DK or Vintage DK or Eco Tweed DK<br />

Needles: 3.5mm & 4.0mm!<br />
