<h2>Riverbend Beanie by: Aspen Leaf Knits.</h2>
<a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/riverbend-beanie"><img src="/img/riverbend_beanie.jpg"></a>Super jazzy hat! Knitted in super bulky yarn with 9.0mm needles this one will fly off the needles. We are suggesting <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/estelle-ripple">Estelle Ripple</a> for the multi bands, paired with <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/estelle-bulky">Estelle Bulky</a> for the solids. Make a combo of multi & white/ecru OR Rich Plum/Tanzanite for a darker background. You will need 1 of each and a set of 8 inch 9.0mm DPN's. Pattern is $6.00US on Ravelry

<h2>The Lopi Has Arrived!</h2>
<img src="/img/lopi.jpg"></a>After a long wait of almost a year we have been restocked with Lett-Lopi (worsted weight) & Alafoss Lopi (chunky). Our two Icelandic yarns. There are newly added colours as well.

For those of you who are not familiar, this yarn is a woolly wool. Suitable for outer garments or items that you wear over a turtleneck or shirt. And they are warm, warm, warm!
