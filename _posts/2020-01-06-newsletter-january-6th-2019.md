- Time to Sign-up for Winter Classes & KAL's
Sweaters, Hats, Cowls, Socks & Shawls
- By January the rush of the holidays is over and it is time to settle down to some serious knitting!<br /><br />

<h1>Note:   We are now offering Saturday Classes !!</h1>
To try to accommodate our knitters who are not able to attend classes during the week, we have added Saturday morning dates (10-12am). Not all projects will be available on all days. We have tried to make it as interesting as possible for everyone.
<br /><br />
Projects will be 1 - 3 classes in length (please watch your dates) and KAL's will begin with 1 or 2 classes and extend for 8-10 weeks to complete the project.
<br /><br />
Some will require knitting homework before the class or a pre-requisite to be able to complete. So please read the project descriptions carefully. 

Prices are all inclusive: 
Yarn (you choose the colour we choose the type)<br />
The January surprise envelopes will not apply to classes or the yarn required for classes/KAL's. They are already discounted in the combo pricing.<br />
Pattern<br />
Lesson(s) <br />
HST is additional <br />
Needles are not provided or included<br />

Classes begin January 13, 2020 so make your selections & get signed up now!
