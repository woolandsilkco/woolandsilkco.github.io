Numbers 393-397 are all just out of the box. Named after Greek gods, they are strong & beautiful. 437 yds per ball and a great price.<br />

<h2>Footprints</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/wool-addicts-footprints"><img src="/img/footprints.jpg"></a> <br /> It might be a sock yarn but we can think of so many other uses for it! Fantastic for colourwork sweaters that are calling for colour marled yarns. So soft and squishy.

45% Cotton, 42% Superwash Wool, 13% Polyamide 400m / 437yds needle: 2.5-3.5mm gauge: 28-30sts = 4inches<br />

<h2>Hinterland by: Jennifer Steingass</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/hinterland-5"><img src="/img/hinterland.jpg"></a><br />

Inspired by the northern lights in Norway. This sweater features easy top down & seamless construction, is knit entirely in the round, & options for a rolled or ribbed neckline are included. The colorwork yoke is enjoyable, rhythmic, & engaging to knit & with just 2 colors per row, this pattern is suitable for those who are new to colorwork. The cuffs are my favorite part about this design! We knitters often joke about being stuck on sleeve island, but with fun colorwork at the end, it might just motivate you to bang these sleeves out.

All of the colourwork can happen with a yarn like <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/wool-addicts-footprints"><Footprints</a> (see above here) or Millefiori Light. You do the knitting and let the yarn do the colour changing hard work.

<br /><br />Pattern is available to purchase on Ravelry $7.00 USD<br />

  <h2>Knitted Knockers</h2>
<p><a href="https://knittedknockerscanada.com/"><img src="/img/knitted_knockers.jpg"></a>
<br />
We are proud to assist with this program as a drop-off site for completed knockers. Today we packaged up 49 knockers of all sizes to send in. Thank you to everyone who donated their knitting time to create them. If you are interested in knitting some please pop in or go onto their webpage. The patterns are free but specific yarns must be used due to the fact that they must be soft against the skin. See the list on the webpage or ask in-store and we can direct you to the correct ones.<br />
