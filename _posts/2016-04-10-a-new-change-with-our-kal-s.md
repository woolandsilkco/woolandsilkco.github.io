Now to be worked as a group class on Saturday mornings 10am-12pm. Every so many weeks there will be a new Knit A Long offered.  It will be a project that features a particular yarn (sometimes a new one into the store) or a certain technique or both together.  The yarn, pattern & accessories will be offered at regular price but the class will only be a single one-time fee (not per session) ($20 to $60). Schedule of group class will be listed with each KAL. This is a good way to learn & get projects completed.
