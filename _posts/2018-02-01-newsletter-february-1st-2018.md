<strong>Non-Wool Sock Yarn</strong>

For our customers who are not able to tolerate wool we keep several lines of yarn that do not contain any wool. These are 4 new colours of sock yarn in a new brand that offer wool-free comfort. This yarn also has a bit of elasticity which works well with some patterns.  A good choice for summer socks as well.
 
$5.19   /50g ball
(you will require 2 balls to make one pair of socks)

<strong>Drops Alpaca</strong>

A lovely sport weight yarn made from 100% Alpaca. Very soft to the touch we have chosen this to replace the CEY Fresco which is now only available from the U.S.  We have brought in 4 colours to replace what is now gone from Fresco.  Great price!
