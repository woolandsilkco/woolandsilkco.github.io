**It's BINGO Time!**

So much fun was had last year with our Knitting/Crocheting BINGO we have decided to 
do it again this year!  Just come in and pick up a free Bingo card. There are new projects & choices for 2016. You can begin now in May and Bingo is open until August 31st with final prizes being drawn in September. 

**Feature Project**

**Pleasant Trip Cowl** _pattern by Laura Aylor ($4.00US)_  - Knitted in Universal Yarns Little Bird. A lovely comfortable cowl that can be worn long or doubled up. We have knitted the sample using only 1 ball of Little Bird (which makes it not quite as high) but you could use 2 and take it to the full pattern height of 10 inches. Definitely at least a 3 season wearable addition to your wardrobe. 
This is a lovely sport weight yarn with the feel of pima cotton or bamboo but the surprising reality of 100%  Acrylic. Just new into the store, you will be amazed by this yarn!      
Easy to follow pattern completed on a 3.5mm 80cm circular needle. Sample knitted by our Helen W. in colourway #110 (New Leaf)

** Purchase of yarn for project – 15% off**
 
**Feature Knit Along (KAL)                      $20.00 (+ supplies & pattern)**

Spring Forward Cowl   by Diane L. Augustin
This is the second of our group KAL's.  Here's something new to try. A beaded cowl!
Knitted at a comfortable length in beautiful jewel tone colours this cowl can really dress-up an outfit. Pre-registration is preferred. You will select your Berroco Mykonos yarn colour (1 skein) and the complimentary bead colour while registering for the class. Pre-stringing of beads needs to be completed prior to class.

**-this is a 2 class KAL** (10am-12pm)

   Dates:  Sat May 7 & Sat June 4th

**International Knit in Public Day !!**

To join in with our fellow worldwide knitters we will be celebrating _**International Knit in Public Day**_. This falls on _**Saturday, June 18th**_ and coincides with the Shelburne Street Festival and classic car show. Please come and join us. Weather permitting we will be "sidewalk" knitting and showcasing our talents!  Please bring a comfortable lawn chair if you are planning to attend (we do have a few but possibly not enough). 

**Lakeside Yarn Crawl**

We will be participating in the Lakeside Yarn Crawl this year. It runs from June to September and features several shops, a passport, a draw, a grand prize and a feature pattern.  Details will follow with the June newsletter and passports will then be available
