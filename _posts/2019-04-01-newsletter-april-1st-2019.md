<strong>New Classes & KAL's are starting soon!</strong>  

We have put together an interesting array of technique classes and KAL's to take us right through the summer months
 
<strong>Classes</strong>
2 at a time socks (3 classes)
Elizabeth Zimmerman Baby Surprise Jacket
(2 classes)      $64.00
<strong>Techniques (free part balls) </strong>           $20.00 each

Tech - Intro to Brioche
Tech - Finishing Your Knitted Garment
Tech - 3 Kinds of Buttonholes
Tech - 2 colour Fair Isle
(tech classes are single classes)
<strong>KAL's</strong>  
KAL classes are free. The idea of KAL's is for everyone to knit the same garment, come weekly for 8 weeks, and complete their item. An instructor will be present to aid with any knitting difficulties. While the 3 garments are different, this is not a specific technique learning class. 
Sunday Cardigan              
Nightshift Shawl
Sunset Highway
<strong>Class</strong>
Papillon shawl (includes yarn)    $75.00

It is understood that yarns for all classes & KAL's are to be purchased from W&S Co.
