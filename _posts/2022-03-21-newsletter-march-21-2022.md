<h2>Hitofude KAL - March 24, April 21, May 5, May 19</h2>

A lace cardigan that is easier to knit than you might think!<br /><br />
by:  Hiroko Fukatsu<br /> Purchase pattern on Ravelry.  <br />
As implied by the name “Hitofude”, meaning a single brush stroke in Japanese, this open front cardigan with an allover lace pattern is worked in one “yarn stroke” -- a continuous strand without cutting the yarn.<br /><br />
The yarn stroke starts from the upper body and sleeves worked together in a rectangular piece, then moves to lower body, where the lace pattern increases evenly, creating a gentle drape.<br /><br />

Level - intermediate<br /><br />

Sizes:  30 to 54"<br /><br />

Materials<br />
- fingering weight yarn (2 to 4 skeins)<br />
- check pattern for quantities<br />
 - Needles:  a 3.5mm x 80cm circular, 1 additional 3.5 for 3-needle bindoff,crochet hook, waste yarn & stitch markers<br />
- Gauge:  20sts/32 rows = 4inin lace pattern<br />

<h2>Frank Shawl - KAL</h2>

by: Joji Locatelli<br />
A very easy and stunning shawl, inspired by the work of artist Frank Stella, this design is a study in geometry.<br /><br />
Triangular pieces are assembled together to create a spectacular wrap with a unique shape that is both beautiful and stunning to wear, with many tips, all in different shades.<br /><br />
I played with a gradient of grays, and my favorite color, gold, to give this shawl a vintage vibe.<br /><br />
The Frank Shawl is constructed as 3 triangular sections, joined together when working the last one of them.<br /><br />
Skill level: Beginner<br /><br />
FINISHED MEASUREMENTS<br /><br />
97” (244 cm) from side to side and 39” (98 cm) from top to bottom at deepest point.<br />

<h2>Sock 1 - Mielle Sock Set</h2>
<img src="/img/2022sock1.jpg"><br />
This set is a collection of two patterns, shorty (beginner friendly) and classic (more adventurous), using a common honeycomb like stitch and techniques to celebrate your favorite yarns. The pattern includes modification notes to easily change sock style resulting in many options.
These socks are knit from the top down with a classic heel flap and gusset, rounded heel and toe, and allow for variable foot lengths. The instructions are both written and charted.<br /><br />
5 sizes: 1 (XS), 2 (S), 3 (M), 4 (L), 5 (XL)<br /><br />

<h2>Masking</h2>
                  
On Monday March 21st the Province of Ontario is lifting the mask restrictions. There has been much discussion about this. While some are totally ready to embrace this freedom, others are not. People that are immuno-compromised, have elderly relatives/friends or just don't feel that they are ready will likely continue to mask. The number of cases in Dufferin County, and particularly Shelburne are low. In the store we usually have single shoppers or groups of 1-2 (not crowded).<br/><br/>
All that said, we (our staff) have decided to remain masked for the next 9 days (post March break). During this time customers may enter the shop masked/unmasked. Beginning March 29th we will most likely go to an unmasked status for staff.<br/><br/>
Please do what is comfortable for you.<br/><br/>
 
If there are any changes in the Provincial regulations we will be following those accordingly.
