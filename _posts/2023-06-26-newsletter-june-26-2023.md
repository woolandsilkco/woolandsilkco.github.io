Dubbonet by: Thea Coleman</a><br /><br />

Dubonnet is an easy cardigan with a vintage feel, casual enough for jeans and a tee shirt, but also special enough to wear with a lovely sundress. It features 3/4 sleeves, a touch of lace and a hip length, plus delicate lipstick pockets that add pop of color while accenting the flattering, wearable silhouette. Lace breaks up the body and is centered on the low waist, above a deep ribbing for a modern touch and another flattering detail.<br /><br />

Knit seamlessly from the bottom up, this sweater is easy to modify for length, width, or lace panel placement. You can choose to work full or short sleeves as well, without having to rethink the design.<br /><br />

Needle: 3.75mm<br /><br />

Pattern is available for purchase on Ravelry $9.65 CAD<br /><br />

We are suggesting Manos del Uruguay Feliz<br /><br />

 <p><a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/faded-lines-shirt"><img src="/img/faded_lines.jpg"> <br /><br />

Faded Lines</a> by Stephanie Amalaswintha<br /><br />

The shirt is an easy raglan construction. Worked flat in the beginning to shape the
neckline and later on in the round. The recommended yardage is calculated for a 5 cm sleeve and a total length of ca. 55 cm for a slightly cropped look.<br /><br />

If you prefer a longer
shirt remember to calculate more yarn.<br /><br />

Note: This is not a complicated pattern but it has not been tested.<br /><br />

We are suggesting Berroco's Remix Light for this project<br /><br />

Soothe</a> by: Lisa Mutch<br /><br />

Simple garter stitch with mohair eyelets give this long, crescent shaped shawl its subtle softness. Requires both fingering and mohair to complete.<br /><br />

Size: 108" x 14"<br /><br />

Needle: 4.5mm<br /><br />

Yardage: Fingering 580yds, mohair 250yds<br /><br />

Lisa used 5 different colours of fingering & matching mohair lace. We think you could get a spectacular result with a tonal fingering and a coordinating mohair.<br /><br />

We are suggesting Yarns from Heaven - Topaz (2 skeins) as the fingering yarn for this project & Kid-Seta(2 balls) OR Kid Silk (3 balls) OR Silky Kid (2 balls) for the matching mohair<br /><br />
