Have you seen/felt these gorgeous mittens yet?
If you would like to give that oh so special gift this Christmas then you need to knit the Ghostwood Mittens.
Created using 1 strand of Ultra Alpaca held together with 1 strand of Kid-Silk mohair/silk. They are knitted in the round with an after-thought thumb. 

A little bit of cable detail on the back of the hand by the cuff and you have a fabulous mitten. Soft, warm and stunning to wear!

You will be known as the best gift giver this season!

$29.95 (with pattern. Needle not included)

Several luscious shade pairings to choose from.
