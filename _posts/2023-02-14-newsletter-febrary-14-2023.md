<h2> The Knitting Pilgrim & Stitched Glass Tour</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.kirkdunn.com/knitting-pilgrim?syclid=cflumljgulugpnnqtjl0&utm_campaign=emailmarketing_155168669986&utm_medium=email&utm_source=shopify_email"><img src="/img/glass_tour.jpg"></a> <br />

(yes those panels are knitted! And there are actually 3 of them)<br />

Sat Feb 25, 2:00pm at the Grand Theatre in Fergus<br />

Featuring actor and knitter Kirk Dunn, is a multidisciplinary one-man show that combines personal storytelling, image projection, and three huge knitted panels that look like stained glass windows, to explore the connection amongst the Abrahamic faiths: Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The play recounts Kirk’s fifteen-year artistic and spiritual journey of hand-knitting the ambitious project, and looks at why people struggle to get along today, the meaning of art, the hell of grant-writing and the power of love to overcome major obstacles (and minor mishaps).<br />

<h2> Walking in Shade by Anne Hanson</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/walking-in-shade"><img src="/img/shade.jpg"></a> <br />

This asymmetrical shawl in two sizes (petite/tall) is worked side to side in alternating bands of garter stitch and simple-to-work lace mesh. The size is easily adjustible. Off-kilter progression of the striping allows the final fabric to drape into just the right folds without a lot of fuss. Its large size and light fabric offer plenty of options for arranging the shawl in a variety of ways. Finished size 70(84) inches across top edge and 31 (39) inches along BO edge (washed and blocked)
<br /><br />
Yarn requirements 225(375) yards EACH of color 1 (C1, light) and Color 2 (C2, dark)<br /><br />

Pattern calls for 2 colours but the sample knit appears to be in 4 colours. For that four yarn version, sm would be 150yds of each, lg 200yds of each.<br /><br />

Can also be done in a single colour.<br /><br />

<h2> Snowy Mountain Bobble Hat by Abby Sneade</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/snowy-mountain-bobble-hat"><img src="/img/snowy.jpg"></a> <br />

A first time pattern for this designer! Uses fairisle knitting methods are can be topped with an optional pom pom. Takes approximately a half a 100g ball/skein of chunky yarn in green, white and blue. Or the colours of your choice. A pompom can be added. Either made (use the remained of one of the balls) or a fluffy purchased one. She used merino because it’s soft and snuggly and no one likes a scratchy hat!<br /><br />

As the designer is new to pattern writing it may not be perfect but we applaud her efforts!<br /><br />
