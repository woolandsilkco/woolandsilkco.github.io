<p><a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/herriot-fine"><img src="/img/juniper.jpg"></a><br />

If you haven't used this yarn already you really should. At 75% Alpaca and 25% nylon it is classified as a sock yarn. And you can make socks with it. But why would you?? It is butter soft and has the most delicate drape. We have offered 2 pattern suggestions (below here) for shawls that would be just delightful in this yarn.<br /><br />

12 beautiful colours<br /><br />

$ 19.99 per skein (reg $24.99)<br /><br />
