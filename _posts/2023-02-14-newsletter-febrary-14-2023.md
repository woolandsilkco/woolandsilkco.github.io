<p><a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/herriot-fine"><img src="/img/juniper.jpg"></a><br />

If you haven't used this yarn already you really should. At 75% Alpaca and 25% nylon it is classified as a sock yarn. And you can make socks with it. But why would you?? It is butter soft and has the most delicate drape. We have offered 2 pattern suggestions (below here) for shawls that would be just delightful in this yarn.<br /><br />

12 beautiful colours<br /><br />

$ 19.99 per skein (reg $24.99)<br /><br />

<h2> The Knitting Pilgrim & Stitched Glass Tour</h2>

(yes those panels are knitted! And there are actually 3 of them)<br />

Sat Feb 25, 2:00pm at the Grand Theatre in Fergus<br />

Featuring actor and knitter Kirk Dunn, is a multidisciplinary one-man show that combines personal storytelling, image projection, and three huge knitted panels that look like stained glass windows, to explore the connection amongst the Abrahamic faiths: Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The play recounts Kirk’s fifteen-year artistic and spiritual journey of hand-knitting the ambitious project, and looks at why people struggle to get along today, the meaning of art, the hell of grant-writing and the power of love to overcome major obstacles (and minor mishaps).<br />
