The weather is still not that friendly for outside activity but it is great for knitting! There are lots of classes on until the end of April. Come in and sign up.

Note:   We are now offering Saturday Classes !!
To try to accommodate our knitters who are not able to attend classes during the week, we have added Saturday morning dates (10-12am). Not all projects will be available on all days. We have tried to make it as interesting as possible for everyone.

Projects will be 1 - 3 classes in length (please watch your dates)
and KAL's will begin with 1 or 2 classes and extend for 8-10 weeks to complete the project.

Some will require knitting homework before the class or a pre-requisite to be able to complete. So please read the project descriptions carefully. 

Prices are all inclusive: 
Yarn (you choose the colour we choose the type)
     (sock yarn & chunky/bulky yarns on sale are already reduced in class prices. Sale discount will not apply)
