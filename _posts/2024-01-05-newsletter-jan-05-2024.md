Smokeshow vest</a> by: Thea Colman</p>
<p>The overall cable pattern is subtle, with a bit of hidden texture, and the button bands are worked in twisted rib for added visual interest. The ribbed hem plays right into the cable pattern, and the overall effect is simple and classic.</p>
<p>We are suggesting Yak by Lang. So dang soft!</p>
