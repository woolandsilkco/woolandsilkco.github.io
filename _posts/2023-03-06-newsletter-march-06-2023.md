<h2>Knitting Inspiration for Wonderball !</h2>

<h2>Flax: by TinCanKnits</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/flax"><img src="/img/flax.jpg"></a> <br />
Flax is a classic knit. It's been out there for 10 years now and is still as wonderful as ever. Great top-down construction with interesting garter-stitch detail on the shoulders and down the outside of the sleeves. Perfect for our featured Melange Wonderball yarn.

Pattern is a free download on Ravelry<br /><br />

<h2> Worsted Boxy: by Joji Locatelli</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/worsted-boxy"><img src="/img/boxy.jpg"></a> <br />

This is a very simple modern sweater, with a very wide body and skinny sleeves. Worked with a worsted weight yarn at a very loose gauge, it is very flattering, drapey and stylish! A little short row section in the shoulders adds an interesting texture to the sleeves.<br /><br />

Directions are given to make a seamless version (worked in the round) or a seamed version (worked back and forth) of the body. The sleeves and the neckband are worked seamlessly in the round in both versions.<br /><br />

Pattern $9.95CAD on Ravelry<br /><br />
