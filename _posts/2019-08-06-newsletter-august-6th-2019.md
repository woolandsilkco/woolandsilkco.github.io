- August Classes!!
- (Read to the bottom. There's a sale coming up!)

<strong>A KAL (Knit-A-Long)</strong>
Helping you to finish your project!
There is only 1 KAL for the fall series. We have changed the format of the Knit-A-Longs. The first date will be a paid class. Your instructor will discuss the pattern, get you started and answer questions. After that the next 7 will be free. The yarn used must be the one specified by the KAL and purchased at regular price from The Wool & Silk Co.
Designed to help you get your garment finished. These classes do not provide specific techniques but support you with an experienced teacher to work through any difficulties.
