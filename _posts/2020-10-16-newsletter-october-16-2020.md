<h1>Fall is Well Upon Us</h1>

The leaves are falling and those shorter days are noticeable. I realize that Thanksgiving will have a different look for most of us this year but I hope that everyone has contact with family and enjoys their long weekend. 

Sweater knitting is in full force and if you haven't already started then you need to be getting at your Christmas knitting. Below you will find a few ideas for X-mas gifting and some great deals.

<h1>Get Ready 4 Christmas</h1>

<img src="/img/xmas2020a.jpg" /> 
Each year we set up 4 kits for Christmas knitting. This year we are featuring a ladies hat (Confection Sparkle)-chunky, a cowl  (Slip Stitch Cowl)-super bulky,  lounging socks (Movie Night Slipper Socks)-super bulky & a man's hat (Hill 60)-worsted.
**All of the projects are in worsted weight or higher which make for quick knits in the pre-Christmas rush**

Each kit comes complete with all materials to knit the project and the patterns. You must take all 4 to get the great discount price.

$72.00  (Reg $82.00)
