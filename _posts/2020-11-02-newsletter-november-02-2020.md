<h1>Fall/Winter Knitting</h1>

We are definitely hard into the Fall/Winter knitting season. Leaves are almost off the trees and a chill is definitely in the air. Just like this lovely sheep above here we are ready to put our woolies on. 
 
<hr />
Our Get Ready for Christmas feature is well underway. We made a slight calculation error and you are actually getting about $95.00 of goods for $72.00 when you purchase all 4 kits. Excellent Value!

(Kits can be purchased singly but do not get the reduced price)

Each year we set up 4 kits for Christmas knitting. This year we are featuring a ladies hat (Confection Sparkle)-chunky, a cowl  (Slip Stitch Cowl)-super bulky,  lounging socks (Movie Night Slipper Socks)-super bulky & a man's hat (Hill 60)-worsted.There are multiple colours to choose from in each project (these are just our samples).
**All of the projects are in worsted weight or higher which make for quick knits in the pre-Christmas rush**

Each kit comes complete with all materials to knit the project and the patterns. You must take all 4 to get the great discount price.

$72.00  (Reg $82.00)
