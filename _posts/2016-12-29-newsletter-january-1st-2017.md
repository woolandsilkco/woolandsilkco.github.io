[[ kal picture 1 ]]

The Back East Wrap is a gorgeous asymmetrical triangular shawl worked in two sections. First the center triangular portion is worked from side to side. Stitches are picked up along the edge and combined with the live side stitches to add on a wide border in a top down triangular fashion. This interesting construction allows for the stripes and texture motifs to be worked in different directions, creating a visually appealing, large and cozy wrap to keep you warm through those chilly months.
