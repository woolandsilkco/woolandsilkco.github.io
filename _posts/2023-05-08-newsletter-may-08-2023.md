Grapefruit Pink Lady by Thea Coleman</a><br /><br />

Grapefruit Pink Lady is a cute, fresh piece you can add to your wardrobe right now. It’s an easy knit, and the perfect thing to wear with a linen dress or high waisted bottoms in Spring, then layered with a longer shirt and jeans as the weather cools again.<br /><br />

Plus, it’s an incredibly quick project, using only between 600 - 950 yards of worsted weight yarn in an easily memorized motif.<br /><br />

The delicate lace is very simple and totally subtle, but it’s also detailed enough to hold its own. I lined the hem up below the pattern so the rib pattern flows into the lace, and then I made sure the ribbing was nice and deep, both at collar and hem.<br /><br />

We are suggesting <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/vintage">Vintage Worsted</a> for this project.<br /><br />

Pattern available for purchase on Ravelry</p>

Camping Socks by Tania Barley</a><br /><br />

A simple 3 x 1 broken rib pattern and garter stitch make these socks quite stretchy that ensures great fit and comfort. These socks are knitted from the cuff down and feature a very simple yet comfortable ‘strong style’ heel.
<br /><br />
All the pattern instructions and measurements are given for fingering weight yarn, however the pattern also contains tips and suggestions on how to adjust it for any other yarn weight and thickness. You can also easily play around with the textured wrapped stitches on the leg of the sock and easily modify the pattern to your liking.
<br /><br />
We are suggesting Vintage sock for this project. You will be very pleasantly surprised with the beautiful softness of this yarn<br /><br />

Thallo by Sarah Monroe</a><br /><br />

If you are looking for some yoke texture instead of colourwork, then this is the one for you.<br /><br />

A circular yoke pattern, knit top down in the round. Includes short row shaping for back as well as instructions for short or long sleeves.<br /><br />

We are suggesting <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/feliz">Manos Del Uruguay Feliz</a> for this project. A beautiful superwash merino & modal blend.<br /><br />
<br /><br />

<p><a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/17-elevation"><img src="/img/elevation.jpg"> <br />
#17 Elevation by Audrey Drysdale</a>

Drysdale’s ridged tee will soon have a beloved space in your knitted wardrobe. The body is worked in one neat piece from the neck, with sleeves worked in the round after the raglan increases have been completed.<br /><br />

Pro tip: use different colors for your end of round and raglan markers, just to keep yourself organized. The purl ridge pattern is a snap, just work 18 rounds of stockinette and pop in one purl round.
<br /><br />
Originally done in a Noro yarn we are suggesting <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/kancha"> Mirasol's Kancha</a>. A blend of lambswool & cotton. OR <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/watercolors">Ella Rae Watercolours</a> OR <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/creative-lazy-hazy-summer-cotton">Creative Lazy Hazy Summer Cotton</a><br /><br />

 <h2>An Announcement</h2>
	  <p><img src="/img/for_sale.jpg"><br /><br />After much thought and consideration I have decided that it is time to sell the Wool & Silk Co. We have been providing you with quality yarns and knitting/crochet accessories for 9-1/2 years now and we value all of our customers immensely. This decision was not reached lightly and I hope that someone with an interest and passion for yarns & knitting will want to take it over.<br /><br />
