##Sock It To 'Em Month

February is Sock It To 'Em Month.  All sock yarns are 20% off.  Let's keep our collective feet warm!

##Sock Club

New to Wool & Silk Co. is the Sock Club.  When you buy sock yarn you will get a card with 8 squares.  Each skein/ball of yarn purchased will get you a stamped square. When 8 squares are filled you get a free ball of sock yarn!  

##Feature Projects

This month we are featuring 2 quick and easy cowls.  Something that's fast to knit and will keep that nasty winter wind out!  Sample knits can be viewed in store.

**Colouful Cowl**

pattern by Diane L. Augustin (free)  - Knitted in Noro Silk Garden yarn (takes two). 
     A cozy combination of Mohair & Silk with 10% wool. That'll keep you warm !
     Just pattern until you run out of yarn!

**OR**

**Purl Ridge Scarf** (PS: it's really a cowl !) 

pattern by Stephen West (free)  - Knitted with a single skein of  Misti Alpaca Pima Cotton & Silk Handpaint yarn.  Beautiful colour changes give a soft look. No itch due to the
