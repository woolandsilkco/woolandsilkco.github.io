<strong>New Yarn</strong>

<img src="/img/julylogo.jpg" />Debbie at the Loving Path has shipped us some spectacular yarn!  It is on her polar fingering base which is a single ply merino. So luscious. Oh and the colours.....to die for. These are just the new shades. We currently have 14 colourways in stock. All are available on-line as well as in store. Stop by to check them out.
