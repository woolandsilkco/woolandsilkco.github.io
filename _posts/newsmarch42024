<p>for Eco Harmony Worsted <a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/whisky-neat">Whisky, Neat: by Thea Colman</a></p>
<p>
A cozy pullover featuring a delicate cable detail around the hem. Once the cable detail is complete, ribs extend upwards into the body, ending in a subtly staggered pattern on the yoke. Simple moments on this sweater are what stands out, and it was an amazingly relaxing knit!</p>

<p>for Alba <a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/quintessential-cardigan-2">Quintessential Cardigan : by Churchmouse Yarns</a></p>
<p>
A timeless little hip-length cardi always manages to look modern. Ours has classic details: a pretty jewel neckline, knit-along button bands, full- or bracelet-length sleeves—all of which are clearly and expertly described in written instructions and quick guides. You’ll even be able to build (or review) your skills with a special technique: ‘clip & turn’ short row shaping.</p>
