               <p><a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/search?q=chunky"><img src="/img/project6.jpg"></a>
             The Kukka Cardigan Chunky is a classic open front cardigan. It is cut closely to the body but not tight-ly and, knitted from fluffy yarns, fits wonderfully under a winter jacket. If you work the
cardigan in a fluffy, light yarn, it is perfect for the transition time in spring and autumn. The Kukka Cardigan Chunky is worked flat top down with raglan increases. The sleeves are worked in rounds with the Magic Loop method, double pointed needles or any other needle system of your choice. The front bands are worked with slip stitches and create the typical “Kukka look” together with the easy to remember rice grain pattern.
	<br/>

Purchase pattern by: rosa p. on Ravelry.  Worked top down & in the round seamlessly. You can knit it in a chunky yarn, with or without added mohair. Or in a soft chunky like Estelle Drift. - <a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/kukka-cardigan-chunky">https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/kukka-cardigan-chunky</a>.

        <p>
Another project idea has found us. Winter series.

The Timbo Vest is a simple yet interesting knit,
suitable for beginners and fast enough to become your go-to gift project.
It is worked from top down in an easy broken rib stitch, with a
stockinette shoulder detail. A free pattern on Ravelry. We are currently working on a sample for in the store. Decided to make the neckline just a few rows instead of the full turtleneck style. Knitted in chunky yarn it will move along quickly for you. I love the idea of it keeping my body warm while allowing my arms to be free. Make it as long or as short as you wish!

Free pattern on Ravelry! Worked top down. Is in the round after armhole sections are completed. Make it in 2 colours or one solid. Either will look nice. We have chosen our new Eco Tweed chunky  to knit the sample.<br /><br />

Level - advanced beginner<br /><br />
Sizes:  XS to XL<br /><br />

Materials<br /><br />

- chunky weight yarn<br />
- check pattern for quantities depending upon size<br />
- Needles:  6.5mm in 40, 60 & 80(or 100)cm circular  (all 3 lengths required)<br />
- Gauge:  15sts/22 rows = 4in in broken rib pattern<br /><br />

A simple top-down raglan pullover in a full range of sizes. Baby (0-6mons) right up to 5X.></p>
        <p>This is more of a project idea than a kit. The 3rd in our winter series. Southwood (by Galt House of Yarn) is a unisex pullover. A free pattern on Ravelry. Top down with a few short rows at the back of the neck (pattern says front but we know it's the back!), raglan sleeve increases and a straight body without any waist shaping. I am currently knitting this for my son-in-law in Juniper Moon's Rustic Aran. Colourway: 1009 Bayleaf. If you follow us on Instagram or Facebook you may have seen my knitting updates. It's going pretty fast.
This is a good first/second pullover pattern for any knitter. I have provided links to the pattern page (click pattern name above or on the photo) and a link to some yarns that I think would make a great sweater for you or the man in your life.
	  </p>
<p>

Southwood now includes options for both a plain raglan neckline (great for beginners!) or with added short-row shaping for a more contoured neckline.</p>
