Flirty by: Kate Oates</a><br /><br />

This convertible pullover features sweet texture detail, pleated sleeves and A-line shaping. Designed with a higher front neckline & scooped back neck, instructions are written so that it can truly be worn with either neckline at the front. This light, mild weather knit includes options for short or long sleeves and cropped or longer length. Sweater is worked seamlessly from the top down with raglan-style sleeves.<br /><br />

We are suggesting sport weight Queensland United for this project.<br /><br />

Cloudburst by: Shania Bilow </a><br /><br />

Cloudburst is a simple boxy tee with all over eyelet patterning in fingering weight yarn. This versatile top can be layered over dresses or worn with a cami underneath and paired with a flowy skirt or jeans. <br /><br />
The top is worked side to side with two identical pieces for the front and back, with stitches cast on provisionally. After working each piece, the front and back are joined together with a 3-needle bind off and sleeves are worked off the remaining stitches. The shoulders are seamed, leaving an opening for the neck. Stitches are picked up along the bottom to create the bottom ribbed border. <br /><br />

We are suggesting Manos Fino for this pullover <br /><br />

A pay pattern on Ravelry $7.00 USD<br /><br />
