 </a><a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/confetti-19"><strong>Confetti Socks </strong></a>by Karin Fernandes
<p>This is a free pattern on Ravelry. Knitted cuff down with an offset 2x2 rib creating an interesting texture.</p>
 <p>Use a matching contrast for toes and upper edge.</p>
 <p>We are suggesting <a href="hhttps://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/superba-cahmeri-luxury-socks">Superba Cashmeri Luxury Socks</a> for the main (it is a bit stripey but oh so wonderful) or any speckled sock yarn.</p>
 <p>For the contrast colour we think that<a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/copy-of-painted-desert"> Teenie Weenie Wool</a>would be a great go to. Just 2 would do the job.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/secret-garden-sweater-2"><img src="/img/secret_garden.jpg"> <br /><br />Secret Garden</a> by Elenor Mortensen
 <p>The Secret Garden Sweater is a top down knitted Sweater with 3/4 sleeves. The body being knit in colourwork has less elasticity than it would have with a single colour. I therefore recommend a positive ease of at least 10cm (4 ins) . Some testknitters have knitted their sweater with long sleeves or as a cardigan. These variations are not part of the pattern.</p>
 <p>Yarn: We are recommending Manos Del Uruguay' <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/copy-of-feliz">Fino</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/copy-of-feliz"><img src="/img/manos_wool.jpg"> <br /><br />
Manos Del Uruguay Fino</a><br /><br />

Elegant and refined, Fino combines the softness of merino wool with the luster of silk in a lightweight yarn that’s perfect for heirloom accessories or luxurious garments. Fino features a new dye process that yields complex, subtle, tonal colors.We recommend buying enough yarn to complete a project. To give an overall blended effect, knit two rows from one skein and then two rows from another.</p>
