          "description":"Oh Thea Coleman what don't we love about this pattern! Chocolate Stout is big and comfy, with distinct allover texture in a cable pattern that’s easily memorized and fun to knit. It features a deep ribbing with worked-in pockets that add to the vintage feel of the sweater. A cozy collar and wide button band keep things bold and comfy. Waist shaping and a flattering modified drop shoulder have been added to the silhouette for a nice fit. And sleeve shaping is worked in an unexpected rib detail under each arm, just for fun. The sweater is worked from the bottom up to the armholes seamlessly. Pockets are added as you work upwards. At armholes, the body is divided into 3 pieces and worked to shoulder. Arms are worked separately and seamed in, and the collar is worked last. Cables are both charted and written"
