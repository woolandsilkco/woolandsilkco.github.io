Yarn:  Lang Alpaca Soxx 4-ply<br><br>

Okay. Okay. I couldn't help myself!!  Started this beautiful lightweight cardigan a few days ago. The textured design is super easy but so effective. I can't even tell you how much I love this yarn. Sock yarn you say? Yup. And it is so very very soft. A joy to work with on the needles. I think I am in Love. Think Spring in Paris.

<h2>Knitting Inspiration</h2>

<h2>Fog Cutter: by Thea Colman</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/fog-cutter"><img src="/img/fog_cutter.jpg"></a> <br />

This one is a striking but simple sweater that’s just perfect for a foggy day at the beach or a cool summer night. Fog Cutter is versatile, flattering, and easy to throw on. It features a beautiful combination of cables, lace, and texture in a panel that undulates like waves over small stones. A split hem, some ribbed detail, and boldly seamed shoulders also add to the interest on this design, and reverse stockinette on sleeves and back keep the focus on the details.

Finished sweater Sizes (with 5" positive ease-measured at the bust) 37.75" to 59.75"<br /><br />

We are introducing <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/reborn-wool-recycled">Kremke Reborn Wool Recycled</a><br /><br />
another contribution to the slow fashion movement! With a wooly and natural feeling, and rich colours that have a somewhat gentle tweed-like effect, this yarn makes the most of post-consumer recycled textiles. Made from a blend of recycled wool garments 65%, recycled polyster sourced from PET bottles 25%, and nylon 10%, it is perfect for clothing and accessories with a classic look. 200m/220yds. 13 colour choices!

<h2> Iva Hat: by Olga Beckmann</h2>

A fold-over brim beanie worked in the round from brim to crown. Ribbed pattern. Integrated flat shaping.<br /><br />

The chunky / bulky weight beanie is worked in 1x1 ribbing and offers a variety of styling options as well as choices for round or square crowns, and smaller or larger sizes.

     <h2> London Fog Slipover by Caidree</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/london-fog-slipover"><img src="/img/london_fog.jpg"></a> <br />

London Fog is a beginner friendly knitting pattern. It is bold and chunky vest/slipover that will effortlessly keep you dressed up and warm. You will cast on and work in the round continuously to shape the front and back plus saddle shoulders, then separate the front and back to shape arm holes and after that you will connect the front and back to work the body in the round. The slipover is worked in stockinette stitch all the way through. It is meant to be worn with little ease. 0 – 10 cm of positive ease is built into the pattern.

Sizes XS to 5XL<br /><br />

230-600yds of Superbulky yarn<br /><br />

Yarn thoughts (these are all superbulky yarns-no matter the name):<a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/estelle-bulky"> Estelle Bulky (solids)</a>,

 you may also combine 2 strands of a chunky or a bulky yarn to create a superbulky. I would suggest doing a gauge swatch if you do this.<br /><br />

    <h2> Under the Rainbow shawl by Collete Audrey</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/under-the-rainbow-3"><img src="/img/rainbow_shawl.jpg"></a> <br />

What a great way to use a colour gradient yarn cake! This easy to knit pattern begins at one tip and goes to the other with a set of increases and thrown to complete the border.

Yarn amt: 875yds<br /><br />

Size:<br /><br />
About 170 cm (70 inches) long after blocking.<br /><br />

Pattern is free on Ravelry<br /><br />

We think that KFI's <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/kfi-collection-lace-degrade">Painted Lace Degrade </a>is perfect. Don't let the word "lace" put you off. It is a 4-strand fingering weight yarn in 100% cotton. And at 874yds it is just perfect for this project.

The (no need to) Panic sweater was designed for new sweater knitters who have done shawls or other projects but are intimidated to make a sweater.
There are long-sleeved instructions and two short sleeved versions.<br /><br />

Dam De Fer<br />
By: Marie Amelie Designs<br /><br />

A free pattern on Ravelry<br /><br />

Decorated with an easy-to-work slip stitch pattern, this cardigan will have you dressed for the Eiffel Tower in no time. Inspired by the ironwork that makes up the exquisitely engineered tower, you will work from the top down, seamlessly to have a season-spanning sweater tout de suite. Pattern provided in both charted and written formats.<br /><br />

<p>We are thinking of our new Alpaca Soxx 4-ply for this project. Fingering weight, 70% alpaca, and oh so soft and squishy. You can make socks out of it but why would you?

  <p>  <strong>PROJECT IDEA #8 - The Boulevard Blanket</strong></p>
<img src="/img/project8.jpg">
The Boulevard Blanket….it’s quick, easy, chunky, warm and reversible! At first glance you might think this pattern is just simple garter stitch. Look again!<br/>
An easy K3, P3 repeat pattern creates a subtle striping effect. The name of this pattern is inspired by the beautiful tree lined boulevards of my hometown….Kansas City.

  <p>  <strong>PROJECT IDEA #7 - Novice Sweater Junior</strong></p>
<p><img src="/img/project7.jpg"></a>

The Novice Sweater Junior is knit seamlessly from the top down. That means that you will begin by knitting the neckband, then the yoke, then the body, and finally the sleeves. The sweater is knit in stockinette stitch, while the neckband, bottom edge (waist band), and cuffs are knit in rib.
