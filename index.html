Yarn:  Lang Alpaca Soxx 4-ply<br><br>

Okay. Okay. I couldn't help myself!!  Started this beautiful lightweight cardigan a few days ago. The textured design is super easy but so effective. I can't even tell you how much I love this yarn. Sock yarn you say? Yup. And it is so very very soft. A joy to work with on the needles. I think I am in Love. Think Spring in Paris.

<h2>Featured Pattern</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/shiftigan"><img src="/img/shiftigan.jpg"></a> <br /> Shiftigan Cardigan by: Andrea Mowry A new addition to the "Shift" series of garments. The shifting colors and fun texture will keep you knitting “just one more row!” all the way to the end, and it is sure to be one of the most eye-catching pieces in your wardrobe! This sweater is knit from the top down, in the round, using stranded colorwork. It is knit seamlessly and then steeked. Easy to make longer if you wish. We are suggesting Fino by Manos , Feliz by Manos , Drops Alpaca , or Juniper Moon's Patagonia for the main colour. Then select a colour changing yarn of either our brand new Wool Addicts Footprints or Berroco Millefiori Light.To create the beautiful patterning. Don't worry about the steeking. We can help you with that!

Pattern is available to purchase on Ravelry $8.00USD<br />

  <h2>Fever Dreams Shawl by: Kate Burge & Rachel Price</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/fever-dreams"><img src="/img/fever.jpg"></a>
<br />
An intermediate level pattern that features a simple slipped stitch dot motif and an interesting and easy to memorize honeycomb stitch. You can create it with a main and 3 accent colours or we think a main an 1 colour changing yarn might do very well. Two sizes, 68" or 94" (purchase yarn accordingly) We are suggesting <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/highland-alpaca-fine">Highland Alpaca Fine</a> or <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/collections/estelle/products/alpaca-merino-fine">Alpaca Merino Fine</a> or <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/vintage-sock">Berroco Vintage Sock</a> (it's super soft) for the main colour. You can choose your 3 contrasting colours from these as well. Or perhaps Laines du Norde Paint Sock for some fun honeycombs. 
 <br /><br/>Pattern is $7.00USD on Ravelry<br />

<h2>Korshaven Sweater Junior by: Tonje Hodne</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/korshavn-sweater-junior"><img src="/img/sweaterjr.jpg"></a>
<br />
This has to be the sweetest little basketweave sweater I've seen in a long time. In a huge size range of 3 months to 14 years you can knit one for everyone! Originally knit in a 100% wool together with a mohair strand, we are thinking of something softer and easier to care for. <a href"https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/vintage-dk">Vintage DK</a> offers a wide range of colours in a superwash (machine wash, flat to dry). Other choices are <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/alpaca-merino-dk">Alpaca Merino DK</a>, <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/highland-alpaca-dk">Highland Alpaca DK</a>, <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/eco-tweed-dk">Eco Tweed DK</a> (hand wash) or <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/cherished-dk">Cherished DK</a>(anti-pilling, 100% acrylic, machine wash & dry) for this knit. Perfect for boys or girls.

 <h2>Waterrock Slipover by: Jennifer Kelley</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/waterrock"><img src="/img/waterrock.jpg"></a>
<br />
I'm kind of enchanted with the slipover idea right now. Keep your body warm but free your arms to do what you want. This pattern offers a wide size range , is knitted in the round and has a great little side hem slit to make it sit just right. Knitted bottom-up you can easily adjust the length when you get near the underarm area. DK weight means the fabric should be fairly light. We are thinking <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/patagonia">Juniper Moon's Patagonia</a>, <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/eco-tweed-dk">Eco Tweed DK</a>, <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/wool-pop">Wool Pop</a> (fab yarn and it's on sale!),

 <h2>Glacier - Dubble(Double) Mittens by: The Weststrand Sisters</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/glaciar---dubble-mittens"><img src="/img/glacier.jpg"></a>
<br />
Lined mittens that fit snugly and are warm even in colder temperatures. A classic ski mitten was the inspiration. The outside of each mitten is decorated with a texture pattern reminiscent of a glacier surface. Requires an aran/worsted for the exterior and a sport for th interior. We suggest <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/eco-shetland-worsted">Eco Shetland Worsted</a>, <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/santa-cruz">Santa Cruz</a> or <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/vintage">Vintage Worsted</a> for outer and <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/alpaca">Drops Alpaca</a> on the inside.

The (no need to) Panic sweater was designed for new sweater knitters who have done shawls or other projects but are intimidated to make a sweater.
There are long-sleeved instructions and two short sleeved versions.<br /><br />

Dam De Fer<br />
By: Marie Amelie Designs<br /><br />

A free pattern on Ravelry<br /><br />

Decorated with an easy-to-work slip stitch pattern, this cardigan will have you dressed for the Eiffel Tower in no time. Inspired by the ironwork that makes up the exquisitely engineered tower, you will work from the top down, seamlessly to have a season-spanning sweater tout de suite. Pattern provided in both charted and written formats.<br /><br />

<p>We are thinking of our new Alpaca Soxx 4-ply for this project. Fingering weight, 70% alpaca, and oh so soft and squishy. You can make socks out of it but why would you?

  <p>  <strong>PROJECT IDEA #8 - The Boulevard Blanket</strong></p>
<img src="/img/project8.jpg">
The Boulevard Blanket….it’s quick, easy, chunky, warm and reversible! At first glance you might think this pattern is just simple garter stitch. Look again!<br/>
An easy K3, P3 repeat pattern creates a subtle striping effect. The name of this pattern is inspired by the beautiful tree lined boulevards of my hometown….Kansas City.

  <p>  <strong>PROJECT IDEA #7 - Novice Sweater Junior</strong></p>
<p><img src="/img/project7.jpg"></a>

The Novice Sweater Junior is knit seamlessly from the top down. That means that you will begin by knitting the neckband, then the yoke, then the body, and finally the sleeves. The sweater is knit in stockinette stitch, while the neckband, bottom edge (waist band), and cuffs are knit in rib.
