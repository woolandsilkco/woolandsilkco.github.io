Yarn:  Lang Alpaca Soxx 4-ply<br><br>

Okay. Okay. I couldn't help myself!!  Started this beautiful lightweight cardigan a few days ago. The textured design is super easy but so effective. I can't even tell you how much I love this yarn. Sock yarn you say? Yup. And it is so very very soft. A joy to work with on the needles. I think I am in Love. Think Spring in Paris.

	  <p><strong>Project Idea #11 </strong></p>
<p> <img src="/img/project11.jpg"><br />
By: Casapinka<br />
A purchase pattern on Ravelry<br />

The (no need to) Panic sweater was designed for new sweater knitters who have done shawls or other projects but are intimidated to make a sweater.
There are long-sleeved instructions and two short sleeved versions.<br /><br />

 <img src="/img/fur_sweater.jpg"><br />
Dam De Fer<br />
By: Marie Amelie Designs<br /><br />

A free pattern on Ravelry<br /><br />

Decorated with an easy-to-work slip stitch pattern, this cardigan will have you dressed for the Eiffel Tower in no time. Inspired by the ironwork that makes up the exquisitely engineered tower, you will work from the top down, seamlessly to have a season-spanning sweater tout de suite. Pattern provided in both charted and written formats.<br /><br />

<p>We are thinking of our new Alpaca Soxx 4-ply for this project. Fingering weight, 70% alpaca, and oh so soft and squishy. You can make socks out of it but why would you?

  <p>  <strong>PROJECT IDEA #8 - The Boulevard Blanket</strong></p>
<img src="/img/project8.jpg">
The Boulevard Blanket….it’s quick, easy, chunky, warm and reversible! At first glance you might think this pattern is just simple garter stitch. Look again!<br/>
An easy K3, P3 repeat pattern creates a subtle striping effect. The name of this pattern is inspired by the beautiful tree lined boulevards of my hometown….Kansas City.

  <p>  <strong>PROJECT IDEA #7 - Novice Sweater Junior</strong></p>
<p><img src="/img/project7.jpg"></a>

The Novice Sweater Junior is knit seamlessly from the top down. That means that you will begin by knitting the neckband, then the yoke, then the body, and finally the sleeves. The sweater is knit in stockinette stitch, while the neckband, bottom edge (waist band), and cuffs are knit in rib.

Purchase pattern by: PetiteKnit on Ravelry.  Excellent beginner project. She used lace weight + fingering + fingering to achieve chunky weight. You can just use a chunky yarn to make the knitting easier. - <a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/novice-sweater-junior">https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/novice-sweater-junior</a>.
