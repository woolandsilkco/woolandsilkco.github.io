<p>A lace cardigan that is easier to knit than you might think!<br />

Call the store to sign up (519) 925-6194<br /><br />
 
Hitofude by:  Hiroko Fukatsu<br />
Purchase pattern on Ravelry.  <br />
As implied by the name “Hitofude”, meaning a single brush stroke in Japanese, this open front cardigan with an allover lace pattern is worked in one “yarn stroke” -- a continuous strand without cutting the yarn.<br />
The yarn stroke starts from the upper body and sleeves worked together in a rectangular piece, then moves to lower body, where the lace pattern increases evenly, creating a gentle drape.

<h2>Frank Shawl - KAL</h2>
<img src="/img/frankshawl.jpg">
by: Joji Locatelli<br />
A very easy and stunning shawl, inspired by the work of artist Frank Stella, this design is a study in geometry.<br /><br />
Triangular pieces are assembled together to create a spectacular wrap with a unique shape that is both beautiful and stunning to wear, with many tips, all in different shades.<br /><br />
I played with a gradient of grays, and my favorite color, gold, to give this shawl a vintage vibe.<br /><br />
<p>The Frank Shawl is constructed as 3 triangular sections, joined together when working the last one of them.<br /><br />
Skill level: Beginner<br /><br />
FINISHED MEASUREMENTS<br /><br />
97” (244 cm) from side to side and 39” (98 cm) from top to bottom at deepest point.<br />

	  <p><strong>Project Idea #11 </strong></p>
<p> <img src="/img/project11.jpg"><br />
By: Casapinka<br />
A purchase pattern on Ravelry<br />

The (no need to) Panic sweater was designed for new sweater knitters who have done shawls or other projects but are intimidated to make a sweater.
There are long-sleeved instructions and two short sleeved versions.<br /><br />

	  <p><strong>Project Idea #10 Spring series - Dame De Fer - a beautiful lightweight cardigan. Exactly the right thing for spring.</strong></p>

Dam De Fer<br />
By: Marie Amelie Designs<br /><br />

A free pattern on Ravelry<br /><br />

Decorated with an easy-to-work slip stitch pattern, this cardigan will have you dressed for the Eiffel Tower in no time. Inspired by the ironwork that makes up the exquisitely engineered tower, you will work from the top down, seamlessly to have a season-spanning sweater tout de suite. Pattern provided in both charted and written formats.<br /><br />

<p>We are thinking of our new Alpaca Soxx 4-ply for this project. Fingering weight, 70% alpaca, and oh so soft and squishy. You can make socks out of it but why would you?

The Boulevard Blanket….it’s quick, easy, chunky, warm and reversible! At first glance you might think this pattern is just simple garter stitch. Look again!<br/>
An easy K3, P3 repeat pattern creates a subtle striping effect. The name of this pattern is inspired by the beautiful tree lined boulevards of my hometown….Kansas City.

  <p>  <strong>PROJECT IDEA #7 - Novice Sweater Junior</strong></p>
<p><img src="/img/project7.jpg"></a>

The Novice Sweater Junior is knit seamlessly from the top down. That means that you will begin by knitting the neckband, then the yoke, then the body, and finally the sleeves. The sweater is knit in stockinette stitch, while the neckband, bottom edge (waist band), and cuffs are knit in rib.
	<br/>

Purchase pattern by: PetiteKnit on Ravelry.  Excellent beginner project. She used lace weight + fingering + fingering to achieve chunky weight. You can just use a chunky yarn to make the knitting easier. - <a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/novice-sweater-junior">https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/novice-sweater-junior</a>.

	   <p>  <strong>PROJECT IDEA #6 - Kukka Cardigan</strong></p>
<p><img src="/img/project6.jpg"></a>

The Kukka Cardigan Chunky is a classic open front cardigan. It is cut closely to the body but not tight-ly and, knitted from fluffy yarns, fits wonderfully under a winter jacket. If you work the
cardigan in a fluffy, light yarn, it is perfect for the transition time in spring and autumn. The Kukka Cardigan Chunky is worked flat top down with raglan increases. The sleeves are worked in rounds with the Magic Loop method, double pointed needles or any other needle system of your choice. The front bands are worked with slip stitches and create the typical “Kukka look” together with the easy to remember rice grain pattern.
	<br/>

Purchase pattern by: rosa p. on Ravelry.  Worked top down & in the round seamlessly. You can knit it in a chunky yarn, with or without added mohair. Or in a soft chunky like Estelle Drift. - <a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/kukka-cardigan-chunky">https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/kukka-cardigan-chunky</a>.

Orbits is the fourth design in Rachel Illsley's Einaudi Collection – a collection of knitwear patterns inspired by pieces of music written by Ludovico Einaudi.

Another project idea has found us. Winter series.

Timbo Vest (by Gabriella Calderini) The Timbo Vest is a simple yet interesting knit,
suitable for beginners and fast enough to become your go-to gift project.
It is worked from top down in an easy broken rib stitch, with a
stockinette shoulder detail. A free pattern on Ravelry. We are currently working on a sample for in the store. Decided to make the neckline just a few rows instead of the full turtleneck style. Knitted in chunky yarn it will move along quickly for you. I love the idea of it keeping my body warm while allowing my arms to be free. Make it as long or as short as you wish!

<br />
Free pattern on Ravelry! Worked top down. Is in the round after armhole sections are completed. Make it in 2 colours or one solid. Either will look nice. We have chosen our new Eco Tweed chunky  to knit the sample.<br /><br />

	  <strong>PROJECT IDEA #3</strong>
<p>This is more of a project idea than a kit. The 3rd in our winter series. Southwood (by Galt House of Yarn) is a unisex pullover. A free pattern on Ravelry. Top down with a few short rows at the back of the neck (pattern says front but we know it's the back!), raglan sleeve increases and a straight body without any waist shaping. I am currently knitting this for my son-in-law in Juniper Moon's Rustic Aran. Colourway: 1009 Bayleaf. If you follow us on Instagram or Facebook you may have seen my knitting updates. It's going pretty fast.
This is a good first/second pullover pattern for any knitter. I have provided links to the pattern page (click pattern name above or on the photo) and a link to some yarns that I think would make a great sweater for you or the man in your life.
