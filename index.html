Yarn:  Lang Alpaca Soxx 4-ply<br><br>

Okay. Okay. I couldn't help myself!!  Started this beautiful lightweight cardigan a few days ago. The textured design is super easy but so effective. I can't even tell you how much I love this yarn. Sock yarn you say? Yup. And it is so very very soft. A joy to work with on the needles. I think I am in Love. Think Spring in Paris.

<p>This is a free pattern on Ravelry. Knitted cuff down with an offset 2x2 rib creating an interesting texture.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/secret-garden-sweater-2"><img src="/img/secret_garden.jpg"> <br /><br />Secret Garden</a> by Elenor Mortensen
 <p>The Secret Garden Sweater is a top down knitted Sweater with 3/4 sleeves. The body being knit in colourwork has less elasticity than it would have with a single colour. I therefore recommend a positive ease of at least 10cm (4 ins) . Some testknitters have knitted their sweater with long sleeves or as a cardigan. These variations are not part of the pattern.</p>
 <p>Yarn: We are recommending Manos Del Uruguay' <a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/secret-garden-sweater-2">Fino</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/copy-of-feliz"><img src="/img/manos_wool.jpg"> <br /><br />
Manos Del Uruguay Fino</a><br /><br />

Elegant and refined, Fino combines the softness of merino wool with the luster of silk in a lightweight yarn that’s perfect for heirloom accessories or luxurious garments. Fino features a new dye process that yields complex, subtle, tonal colors.We recommend buying enough yarn to complete a project. To give an overall blended effect, knit two rows from one skein and then two rows from another.</p>

These socks are knit from the top down with a classic heel flap and gusset, rounded heel and toe, and allow for variable foot lengths. The instructions are both written and charted.<br /><br />

<p>Nov 2/22:  Our own Leeanne L. has been working on the Midcoast

	  <h2>Midcoast Pullover KAL - start date Nov 15 (but you can join in anytime)</h2>
<p><img src="/img/midcoast_pullover.jpg">
There was a bit of a discussion at K-W Knitters Fair this year and Midcoast was
decided upon to be a KAL. Jennifer Steingass has done her usual excellent
pattern writing and created this stunning pullover. It takes a main colour with
2 contrasting colours for working the yoke design. We want to share your
progress with everyone so will be posting here and to social media with 
updates via your photos. You can submit pictures to us at woolandsilkco@gmail.com
Please indicate your first & last name. We post just using your first name & your
last initial (eg: Diane G.). If you do not wish your name to be printed at all please
indicate that to us in your email and we will keep you anonymous.
	  Here are some <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/search?q=Midcoast">yarn suggestions</a> for you. Or pop into the shop and we will
get you started.

By: Casapinka<br />
A purchase pattern on Ravelry<br />

The (no need to) Panic sweater was designed for new sweater knitters who have done shawls or other projects but are intimidated to make a sweater.
There are long-sleeved instructions and two short sleeved versions.<br /><br />

Dam De Fer<br />
By: Marie Amelie Designs<br /><br />

A free pattern on Ravelry<br /><br />

Decorated with an easy-to-work slip stitch pattern, this cardigan will have you dressed for the Eiffel Tower in no time. Inspired by the ironwork that makes up the exquisitely engineered tower, you will work from the top down, seamlessly to have a season-spanning sweater tout de suite. Pattern provided in both charted and written formats.<br /><br />

<p>We are thinking of our new Alpaca Soxx 4-ply for this project. Fingering weight, 70% alpaca, and oh so soft and squishy. You can make socks out of it but why would you?

  <p>  <strong>PROJECT IDEA #8 - The Boulevard Blanket</strong></p>
<img src="/img/project8.jpg">
The Boulevard Blanket….it’s quick, easy, chunky, warm and reversible! At first glance you might think this pattern is just simple garter stitch. Look again!<br/>
An easy K3, P3 repeat pattern creates a subtle striping effect. The name of this pattern is inspired by the beautiful tree lined boulevards of my hometown….Kansas City.

  <p>  <strong>PROJECT IDEA #7 - Novice Sweater Junior</strong></p>
<p><img src="/img/project7.jpg"></a>

The Novice Sweater Junior is knit seamlessly from the top down. That means that you will begin by knitting the neckband, then the yoke, then the body, and finally the sleeves. The sweater is knit in stockinette stitch, while the neckband, bottom edge (waist band), and cuffs are knit in rib.

Purchase pattern by: PetiteKnit on Ravelry.  Excellent beginner project. She used lace weight + fingering + fingering to achieve chunky weight. You can just use a chunky yarn to make the knitting easier. - <a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/novice-sweater-junior">https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/novice-sweater-junior</a>.
