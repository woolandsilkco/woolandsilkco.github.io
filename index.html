Yarn:  Lang Alpaca Soxx 4-ply<br><br>

Okay. Okay. I couldn't help myself!!  Started this beautiful lightweight cardigan a few days ago. The textured design is super easy but so effective. I can't even tell you how much I love this yarn. Sock yarn you say? Yup. And it is so very very soft. A joy to work with on the needles. I think I am in Love. Think Spring in Paris.

<p><a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/23-01-texture">23-01 Texture Scarf by Nancy Lekx</a><br /><br />

Here is a little, luxurious project to knit for yourself, or for someone special. Designed originally for DK weight yarn, it works up quite quickly, and the simple 4-stitch, 2-row repeat lends itself to meditative knitting. Knit on the bias, the parallelogram shape creates graceful points on the ends, and the rich texture traps air and helps insulate from the cold.<br /><br />

We are suggesting Drops Baby Merino Sport for this project.<br /><br />

There was a bit of a discussion at K-W Knitters Fair this year and Midcoast was
decided upon to be a KAL. Jennifer Steingass has done her usual excellent
pattern writing and created this stunning pullover. It takes a main colour with
2 contrasting colours for working the yoke design. We want to share your
progress with everyone so will be posting here and to social media with 
updates via your photos. You can submit pictures to us at woolandsilkco@gmail.com
Please indicate your first & last name. We post just using your first name & your
last initial (eg: Diane G.). If you do not wish your name to be printed at all please
indicate that to us in your email and we will keep you anonymous.
	  Here are some <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/search?q=Midcoast">yarn suggestions</a> for you. Or pop into the shop and we will
get you started.

The (no need to) Panic sweater was designed for new sweater knitters who have done shawls or other projects but are intimidated to make a sweater.
There are long-sleeved instructions and two short sleeved versions.<br /><br />

Dam De Fer<br />
By: Marie Amelie Designs<br /><br />

A free pattern on Ravelry<br /><br />

Decorated with an easy-to-work slip stitch pattern, this cardigan will have you dressed for the Eiffel Tower in no time. Inspired by the ironwork that makes up the exquisitely engineered tower, you will work from the top down, seamlessly to have a season-spanning sweater tout de suite. Pattern provided in both charted and written formats.<br /><br />

<p>We are thinking of our new Alpaca Soxx 4-ply for this project. Fingering weight, 70% alpaca, and oh so soft and squishy. You can make socks out of it but why would you?

  <p>  <strong>PROJECT IDEA #8 - The Boulevard Blanket</strong></p>
<img src="/img/project8.jpg">
The Boulevard Blanketâ€¦.itâ€™s quick, easy, chunky, warm and reversible! At first glance you might think this pattern is just simple garter stitch. Look again!<br/>
An easy K3, P3 repeat pattern creates a subtle striping effect. The name of this pattern is inspired by the beautiful tree lined boulevards of my hometownâ€¦.Kansas City.

  <p>  <strong>PROJECT IDEA #7 - Novice Sweater Junior</strong></p>
<p><img src="/img/project7.jpg"></a>

The Novice Sweater Junior is knit seamlessly from the top down. That means that you will begin by knitting the neckband, then the yoke, then the body, and finally the sleeves. The sweater is knit in stockinette stitch, while the neckband, bottom edge (waist band), and cuffs are knit in rib.

Purchase pattern by: PetiteKnit on Ravelry.  Excellent beginner project. She used lace weight + fingering + fingering to achieve chunky weight. You can just use a chunky yarn to make the knitting easier. - <a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/novice-sweater-junior">https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/novice-sweater-junior</a>.
