Yarn:  Lang Alpaca Soxx 4-ply<br><br>

Okay. Okay. I couldn't help myself!!  Started this beautiful lightweight cardigan a few days ago. The textured design is super easy but so effective. I can't even tell you how much I love this yarn. Sock yarn you say? Yup. And it is so very very soft. A joy to work with on the needles. I think I am in Love. Think Spring in Paris.

<h2>Warm Weather Knits & Yarns

Local Yarn Shop (LYS) Day!</h2>
<hr />
<h2>Keep on Knitting !</h2>

<p>Lots of knitters think that once winter is over, so is knitting season. Not true! While your focus may change (hey, who wants to knit a heavy blanket in July anyway?) you can still go on knitting during the warmer months. I choose this time to make more socks and smaller or lightweight items. There are also an incredible array of spring/summer yarns and patterns out there. And even though I don't like to say it, Christmas is always "just around the corner". Particularly for hand-knitted items. Start planning your gifts now. You can work on smaller pieces and purchase yarns on sale or during yarn crawls. Get ahead of the game so you aren't feeling the pressure in September!</p>

Sideways Tee by: Churchmouse Yarns & Teas</a><br /><br />

This deceptively simple top is cleverly knit from the center out to each side, rather than from top to bottom or vice versa. A modern pivot to a familiar style! A tapered shape allows for plenty of ease at the bust, while providing a relaxed and flattering bottom edge at hip length.<br /><br />

We are suggesting Jody Long's <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/alba">Alba</a> or Estelle's <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/eco-tweed-dk">Eco Tweed DK</a> for a slightly tweedy wool oversweater. Giving you warmth over a turtleneck/ blouse for springtime walks.<br /><br />

Or think of <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/creative-lazy-hazy-summer-cotton">Creative Lazy Hazy Summer Cotton DK</a> , 8 great colours to choose from & a slight ripple texture to keep it interesting<br /><br />

 Shearwater Socks by Sandra Buzza</a><br /><br />

This is a very basic top down sock pattern with a beginner friendly textured stitch that gives a subtle blending of colours to soften the look. The instructions are written for magic loop but can be easily converted to double pointed needles.<br /><br />

We are suggesting you try out our <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/bamboo-socks">Pro Lana Bamboo Socks </a>. A no-wool sock alternative that is wonderful to wear for summer. You can make these regular length or shorties, just by adjusting how long you knit the leg portion.<br /><br />

Old River Road by: Kay Hopkins</p></a><br /><br />

A traditional Henley pullover with a modern twist. Itâ€™s the perfect pullover to wear with everything. Picture it over a linen dress or with your favorite jeans and boots. Timeless style and total comfort!<br /><br />

Easy textured stitch pattern. You can choose your hemline finish too & even do the contrast finish on the Henley button placket.<br /><br />

Construction is top-down & in the round in a completely seamless manner. The yoke & body are worked back & forth until the front Henley opening is closed & then the body is worked in the round.<br /><br />

We are suggesting <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/products/united">Queensland United</a> for a great light-weight cardi.<br /><br />

 Tanke Top by: Ankestrick<br /><br />

Worked seamlessly from the top down. An interesting knit, construction wise. Beginner friendly. Optional pockets and hood.<br /><br />

This pattern is looking for a fingering weight yarn and we are thinking that Berroco's Remix Light is just the ticket. A beautiful lightweight yarn made up of nylon, cotton, acrylic, silk & linen. It has a soft cottony feel. Huge selection of colours to help you make it your own.<br /><br />

These socks are knit from the top down with a classic heel flap and gusset, rounded heel and toe, and allow for variable foot lengths. The instructions are both written and charted.<br /><br />

There was a bit of a discussion at K-W Knitters Fair this year and Midcoast was
decided upon to be a KAL. Jennifer Steingass has done her usual excellent
pattern writing and created this stunning pullover. It takes a main colour with
2 contrasting colours for working the yoke design. We want to share your
progress with everyone so will be posting here and to social media with 
updates via your photos. You can submit pictures to us at woolandsilkco@gmail.com
Please indicate your first & last name. We post just using your first name & your
last initial (eg: Diane G.). If you do not wish your name to be printed at all please
indicate that to us in your email and we will keep you anonymous.
	  Here are some <a href="https://www.woolandsilkcoshop.com/search?q=Midcoast">yarn suggestions</a> for you. Or pop into the shop and we will
get you started.

Dam De Fer<br />
By: Marie Amelie Designs<br /><br />

A free pattern on Ravelry<br /><br />

Decorated with an easy-to-work slip stitch pattern, this cardigan will have you dressed for the Eiffel Tower in no time. Inspired by the ironwork that makes up the exquisitely engineered tower, you will work from the top down, seamlessly to have a season-spanning sweater tout de suite. Pattern provided in both charted and written formats.<br /><br />

<p>We are thinking of our new Alpaca Soxx 4-ply for this project. Fingering weight, 70% alpaca, and oh so soft and squishy. You can make socks out of it but why would you?

  <p>  <strong>PROJECT IDEA #7 - Novice Sweater Junior</strong></p>
<p><img src="/img/project7.jpg"></a>

The Novice Sweater Junior is knit seamlessly from the top down. That means that you will begin by knitting the neckband, then the yoke, then the body, and finally the sleeves. The sweater is knit in stockinette stitch, while the neckband, bottom edge (waist band), and cuffs are knit in rib.
	<br/>

Purchase pattern by: PetiteKnit on Ravelry.  Excellent beginner project. She used lace weight + fingering + fingering to achieve chunky weight. You can just use a chunky yarn to make the knitting easier. - <a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/novice-sweater-junior">https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/novice-sweater-junior</a>.
